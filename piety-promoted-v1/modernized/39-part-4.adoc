JOHN WHITING was of Naylsey, in the county of Somerset, yeoman.
In the year 1654, when John Audland and John Camm,
two eminent ministers among the people called Quakers,
were first sent from the north of England to Bristol, and the adjacent counties,
freely to preach the gospel of the grace of God,
and to turn people from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God;
the said John Whiting was convinced of the blessed truth,
and received it in the love thereof, as it was professed by those called Quakers.
He also received the ministers of it into his house,
as he had the truth they declared into his heart; and had meetings held at his house,
to wait upon God, and worship him in the spirit of his dear Son;
and for his ministers freely to preach the gospel of peace and salvation,
as they were sent and required by him.

Although the truth, and those that received it,
were greatly despised in those early days, yet this disciple of Christ,
being made partaker of the like precious faith that was once delivered to the saints,
was zealous for the truth, it being given to him not only to believe,
but also to suffer for the sake of Christ,
among the first of those people to whom he was joined, in that county,
and remained faithful unto death.

In the time of his sickness, and near his end, in a sense of the love of God,
and in love to his wife, with desires for her,
who was then young in the truth which he had received, professed, and had suffered for,
and found peace and comfort in; he exhorted her, saying,
'`As you have believed in the light, so walk in it;`' which showed,
as he loved Christ the true light, he desired she might walk therein.
Truly there are none but those that do evil, who hate the light;
neither can such be saved, until they come to believe and walk in the light,
as all the nations of them that are saved do,
and it is not doubted but this our friend did, and died in the faith of Christ,
and in peace with God through him.

He died the 9th of the Fourth month, 1658; aged about twenty-seven years,
having been convinced four years.

ANNE DEWSBURY, wife of William Dewsbury, then of Wakefield, in Yorkshire,
a hand-maid of the Lord, in the beginning of the Seventh month, 1659,
had a revelation or dream from the Lord, that her life was nearly finished,
and though she might be exercised with much weakness,
yet in the midst thereof the Lord would strengthen her with his presence,
and in him she should overcome the last enemy, which is death.
Having assurance of what was revealed, though at that time she was in good health,
she made ready what might be serviceable when her change came.
About the 29th of the said Seventh month, some weakness came upon her,
which increased so much, that she was many times, to outward appearance,
near laying down the body; yet the Lord preserved her in much patience,
and fresh in his love.

Her husband, being gone to the farthest part of Scotland in the service of truth,
and to publish the day of the Lord, and preach the gospel of Christ,
was moved of the Lord, the 9th of the Eighth month, to return to her,
and on the 28th of the Eighth month, 1659, he was brought to her with joy in the Lord.
After this she was weaker in her body;
but the Lord gave her strength by his living presence to wait till her change came,
which drew near, and being exercised in her affliction, which lay heavy upon her,
she called to her husband, with certain friends, saying,
'`Pray to the Lord that he may ease his afflicted hand-maid.`'
And the Lord moved them to call upon him,
and immediately he took away the heavy affliction.
Then she magnified the Lord, saying, '`Blessed be his name, he has heard our prayers,
and caused his hand-maid to rejoice.`'
Then she embraced her husband in her arms, saying, '`You are my dear husband;
you are my dear husband; you are clear before the Lord, and have discharged your duty,
and answered your place, like an honest man to your wife.
You are blessed of the Lord; large is your reward.`'
Then she expressed these words, saying, '`Dear husband,
I am clear before the Lord your God.
I have no guilt upon my spirit in the covenant of light and life,
sealed with the blood of Jesus.
I am at eternal peace with him.`'

She exhorted the friends present, saying, '`Oh! friends,
get into the covenant of light and life, get into the covenant,
be faithful to the voice that cries, "`This is the way,
walk in it.`"`' Her strength was much gone, yet prayed to God a season longer,
and breathing to the Lord till much spent, some that stood by her,
seeing her lips and mouth move, but did not understand what her words were,
asked her if she spoke to them, and what she wanted.
She answered, '`I spoke not to you, neither do I want any thing of you.`'
Some time after she called for her husband, who was near, and presently spoke to her,
saying, '`Dear wife, what wouldest you with me,`' she answered,
'`I would have you be with me and see me die.`'
He sat down by her; then embracing her husband in her arms,
and with breathings to the Lord, she laid down her body with joy in peace with him.

ANTHONY PATRICKSON, formerly of Stockhow, in the parish of Lamplugh, in Cumberland,
received truth in those parts of the country with the first,
and was made by the Lord a minister of the everlasting gospel,
and travelled in several places of the nation of England, and through Scotland, Ireland,
and the Isle of Man, and was diligent in attending meetings,
and admonishing and instructing the weak, and remained steadfast to the end.
He was of a lamb-like spirit, meek, gentle, not easily provoked, ready to do good,
and walked honestly; was of godly conduct,
and preached therein to those that were enemies to the gospel;
so that they would confess, if all the Quakers were like him,
surely they were a good people.
When taken sick, he saw he must depart this life,
and immediately the incomes of the love of God did break in upon his spirit,
with sweet comfort and consolation, and he said,
'`The Lord has given me an assurance of that blessed
inheritance that never will have end.`'

Thus did this faithful witness finish his testimony,
and end his race of this mortal life, the latter end of the Sixth month, 1660.

MARY PAGE, wife to William Page, of Wellingborough, in the county of Northampton,
a true and faithful hand-maid of the Lord, was taken sick at Warwick prison,
where she had been a prisoner during the space of eleven months and upwards,
for the testimony of the name of the Lord,
which faithful testimony she sealed with her blood,
to the joy of all that beheld her innocent passage, in the power of the eternal God.
This hand-maid of the Lord was enlarged through the
pourings forth of the spirit of the Lord,
and upon her deathbed, in great power,
exhorted all to be faithful and abide in the covenant of light,
and be truly obedient in the meek, lowly, humble,
and self-denying spirit of our Lord Jesus, that,
in the pure love and righteousness of God,
all the dear babes and children of our Father might live in pure union with the Lord,
and one with another, to bear a bold and faithful testimony for the Lord.
Whatever became of the body, it would, she told them, be well every way,
both to the inward and outward man, and to the praise and glory of the Lord forever.

Many times, when she ended her exhortation,
she poured forth her spirit in supplication to the Lord with great fervency,
and what follows is noted.

[.embedded-content-document.prayer]
--

Oh! you powerful God, who are the searcher of all hearts, behold your hand-maid;
and if there be any thing that is not upright before you in the heart of your hand-maid,
make it known to me, you searcher of hearts.
You know I delight to stand approved in your sight in all your ways;
for you are my dear Father,
and have not failed your hand-maid in whatever you have called me to unto this day;
but your presence has attended me, and comforted me through every trial and besetment,
that the enemy of my soul has compassed me about withal.
Oh, blessed God! how have you kept and preserved me to yourself,
and through the power of the Lord Jesus Christ made
me to trample upon the enemy of my soul`'s peace.
Therefore in the name and power of the Lord Jesus Christ, does my soul praise you,
O my God, for my preservation in the power and authority of your spirit,
to bear my faithful testimony for you my God,
all my days until I have finished my course in your will,
oh Lord! my strength and life forever and ever.

And, dear Father, look upon your poor oppressed ones, that have no life but in you.
Oh! how do they cry in a sense of their misery, Lord help, or we die.
Oh Lord! you know their necessities, and their needs are not hid from you,
whose righteousness without you is as filthy rags.
Therefore do they cry unto you.
Nothing will satisfy them but your presence.
Oh, powerful Father! raise up your own begotten in the
power and authority of the Lord Jesus Christ,
to reign over all its besetments, that the mourner may rejoice,
and the bowed-down head may be lifted up,
and every hungry and thirsty soul satisfied with the bread and water of life,
which you freely hand forth by the hand of our Mediator, Christ Jesus our Lord,
not for any thing that we have done, or do, but for your own name`'s sake,
that all flesh and boasting may be laid in the dust, and all crowns cast down before you,
that you alone may have all the glory, whose right is over all, says my soul,
forever and ever.

And yet notwithstanding that all we have or receive,
is in your free mercy in Christ Jesus, yet this gives not any liberty to sin, oh!
Lord, you know, but rather engages us that are born again to abhor ourselves,
and to stand upon our watch diligently,
that the enemy may not enter with any of his wiles,
to cause us to abuse your grace and free mercies,
which you have so freely manifested to us, in the name of the Lord Jesus,
when we had not any power to help ourselves.
Therefore does my soul, with the souls of your dear and faithful children,
cry unto you to keep us pure in your holy power,
that in meekness and true sincerity of heart, we may wait upon you,
and be obedient in whatever you call us unto, even to the loss of husband, or wife,
or children, or whatever else you require.
If it be to the laying down of the outward man, for your glorious truth,
it will be well every way with all that have not any comfort or help but in you,
you ever-living God, to whom be all glory and honor forever.

And holy glorious Father of life,
bless and preserve all the people that make mention of your holy and eternal truth, here,
and here-away, and all my fellow-prisoners, with all your suffering members everywhere,
and my dear husband and children.
God bless and preserve them, and take care of them.
Oh! my God, do well for them every way, in keeping them faithful, with my own soul,
unto the end of our days; whether they be few or many, your will be done.
Oh! you holy eternal God, keep your dear children whom I leave.
Oh Lord! you know how dear they are to me; but I commit them wholly to your care,
oh! my God; whom I know certainly will never fail them that are of an upright heart,
and cannot be satisfied but with your living eternal presence in the Lord Jesus,
to whom I commit them all, if I never see their faces in the outward any more.
I know it will be well both with me and them, as we give up unto you,
to be ordered according to your will, our little time we have here to be upon the earth;
to the glory and honor of your great name, you everlasting glorious Father of life,
to whom alone it does belong, says my soul,
with the souls of all your beloved and faithful children and servants,
that you have chosen to glorify you, who alone are God over all, blessed forever,
and evermore.

When she had done, a friend asked her how she did, she said, '`I am weak,
but I would go home.`'
'`What,`' said the friend, '`to your eternal home?`'
she smiled and said, '`Yes, when it pleases my heavenly Father.`'
Her tender and loving husband being there with her, drew near unto her,
and she in much love stroked him on the face with her hand,
when tears trickled down his cheeks, and friends weeping by her,
after a little time she put her husband from her, and said,
'`Give me up freely into the arms of my heavenly Father.`'
She spoke no more, but within a little time finished her course with joy,
and laid down her body in peace, near the fourth hour in the morning,
the 17th of the Tenth month, 1665.

ROBERT HATTON, of Hatton, in Cheshire, was an eminent minister of the gospel,
and faithful in his labors and travels to preach the same for many years,
of a good example, and adorned the doctrine of Christ,
and in his innocent life preached righteousness at home and abroad.
He was a man of substance, solid and grave, and had a good sense of God upon his spirit,
and a divine understanding of things that tended
to the honor of God and the church`'s peace.
He dearly loved unity, and labored earnestly to promote it.
Every appearance of that which obstructed it was grief to him,
but the increasing fellowship of the church his soul rejoiced in.
He was zealous for the holy truth, and concerned for the glory of God;
his soul hated the very appearance of evil, and +++[+++he was]
a sharp reprover of the loose, profane, heady and high-minded,
and such as were lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.
Being a possessor of the wisdom that is from above, he was mild in exhortation,
and loved tenderness in whomsoever it appeared, and was ready to help the weak.
In suffering, of a noble spirit, bold for the truth, wholly resigned in the will of God,
come what would come, being a man of courage,
and gave great encouragement to suffering friends.
He was a faithful follower of the Lamb,
whatever tribulations or imprisonments he met with, or fines that were imposed upon him,
for the testimony that the Lord had given him to bear.
When spoken to not to preach, he mildly answered, '`If the Lord kindle a sacrifice,
who can forbear to offer;`' and wherever he travelled, he left a good savor behind him.

The day before he departed this life, some of his friends were with him,
to whom he spoke of things relating to the inner man, and said cheerfully,
'`My spirit is very easy, and there is no guilt or burden upon me;`' and at their parting,
he said, '`The Lord knows whether we may see the faces one of another again.`'
The day following, he laid down his head, no doubt in peace with God, and is at rest.

ELIZABETH HUNTINGTON, daughter of Robert Huntington, of Bowsted-hill, in Cumberland,
was of an innocent life and blameless conduct, and a good example,
of a meek and gentle spirit,
careful and tender over all in whom the least appearance of truth manifested itself.
When it pleased the Lord God, by his mighty power,
to raise her up as an instrument in his hand,
to declare his wonders and show forth his praise,
her travels and labors were great for the truth`'s sake, to turn people unto the Lord;
being not satisfied to eat her morsel of bread alone: and her faithfulness to truth,
was as her crown to her latter end.

About the Seventh month, 1678, her mouth was opened by the power of the Lord,
in which she grew exceedingly in the truth, and the Lord gave her wisdom abundantly,
and she became valiant for the Lord,
and bore an honorable testimony for his name and truth, and was a good example.
By her faithfulness many were turned to the Lord,
for she labored earnestly for the good of all people;
and in the year 1679 she travelled with William Johnson, and Jane Seally,
into Northumberland, Bishopric, and Yorkshire.

In 1680 she visited Friends in Scotland,
with her companions Frances Liddle and Richard Perkin,
and returned to her father`'s house after about three months`' travel.
Soon after, she went again into Northumberland, Bishopric, and Yorkshire,
and returned to her father`'s in the Sixth month.
Upon the 3rd of the Seventh month she was taken sick,
and after some time said to her sister, '`I must leave this troublesome world,
and go into immortality.`'
The Lord kept her near to himself; and as though she had fallen asleep,
she laid down her head in peace on the 9th of the Seventh month, and was buried the 10th,
in the twenty-third year of her age.
In the ministry two years.

EDWARD JEFFERYS, of Charlecot in Wiltshire, was concerned,
after he had spoken several precious words to those that were with him upon his deathbed,
to give forth the following paper, which was taken from him by Andrew Shepperd,
and being remarkable and prophetical, it is here inserted:

[.embedded-content-document.paper]

[.blurb]
=== A word of exhortation and warning from the servant of the Lord, Edward Jefferys, written on the 4th of the Eleventh month, 1685. The power of the Lord was in him, and it constrained him powerfully to exhort all to faithfulness, saying,

Dear hearts! a trying day is yet coming on this nation;
for the Lord will yet farther visit it, and he will sweep away thousands to the grave.
I prophesy of it in the pure fear of Almighty God, who speaks through me his instrument,
who have followed him faithfully, and now heaven`'s joys are prepared for me,
and for all those that faithfully follow him, as I have done.
I have walked in the narrow way of life and peace;
but how many are running in the broad way that leads to destruction?
All my time, from my youth upward, I was inclinable to that which was good.
And who would spend away his day in vanity and folly?
seeing the shortness of time that we have here, to that we shall have hereafter.
Dear hearts, be not concerned for me, although the Lord is pleased to remove me,
he will raise up many Friends when I am gone,
for I must certainly go the way of all flesh, and it will be but a little time,
until you will come after me.
Therefore I desire you may so walk, as becomes the blessed truth of our God;
for because of pride,
the Lord is offended with many that are under the profession of the blessed truth,
which I have sought to promote in my day,
and that the Lord would carry it on to his own praise.
Often has my heart been bowed down in the night season,
entreating the Lord in behalf of all;
often crying to the Lord for the restoration of poor fallen man, universally for all.
Often has my spirit been poured out to the Lord for this king, James the Second,
that now is,
that he might be a promoter of the blessed truth and righteousness in his day.
But I fear whether this will be the man; yet, I say,
the Lord will raise up one in his stead, that shall be as a nursing father,
and as a nursing mother in Israel.
God`'s truth shall prosper in this land.

MARGARET BERRY, wife of William Berry, of Choptank, in Maryland, was a mother in Israel,
a teacher of good things, desired the good of all, and the Lord was with her.
She was of a meek spirit, diligent in meeting, and stirred up Friends thereunto,
faithful to the Lord in all her trials and exercises she met with in this world,
not willing to gratify the world`'s spirit;
but ready to testify against all superfluity in what kind soever, as in apparel,
or other ways.
She went plain and decent, in modest apparel, with sobriety,
and was exemplary therein to young women,
preferring a meek and quiet spirit as the best ornament, willing to do good to all,
especially to the household of faith, careful to see all things in order in her family,
discreet, chaste, obedient in her place,
ready to give up her husband freely to the Lord`'s service even to the last,
and loved unity among Friends.

And as she lay upon her deathbed, her husband being from home in the service of truth,
with Daniel Gould, of Rhode Island, in and about Accomack, before several Friends,
she said, '`I am freely given up to the will of the Lord,
and if it be his will to remove me hence,
I am well satisfied with what his will and pleasure is,
and am satisfied that I shall lay down my head in peace with him,
blessed be his name forever.
And though my pain be great upon my outward man, I am kept and borne above my pain,
through the goodness of the Lord, in that I have nothing laid to my charge;
but that I have discharged my conscience in his sight by his assisting power.`'
Finding herself very weak in body, not knowing how short her time might be,
she desired her brother Pitt to write what she had on her mind by way of a will;
and said, at that time, '`I would have all left to my dear husband, if living;
and if any part of what I have done, or the whole, be not agreeable to his mind,
he may make it void at his pleasure; for I would not do any thing that should grieve him,
for he never deserved it at my hands.`'

Then she also desired him to write a letter for her to her husband, as follows:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

[.salutation]
Dear and loving husband, William Berry.

After my endeared love to you and dear Daniel Gould,
I thought it right to let you know that I, being very weak in body,
and not knowing what the will of the Lord is touching my outward man;
yet in this am I comforted and refreshed,
that the Lord is not lacking to refresh me with the smiles of his countenance,
and am satisfied it shall be well with my inward man, and that,
when I shall lay down my head, it will be in peace with the Lord,
into whose hands I commit myself, being freely given up, whether life or death,
which is more satisfaction than my tongue can express.

So, dear heart, having something in my mind, to have a few lines written as a will,
and I could not see your face, which thing I more desired than any outward enjoyment,
so could not confer with you; yet what I have done in that kind,
if I should not see your face in mutability,
it is not my mind to do any thing to grieve you, or against your mind.
But when you peruse what I have written, you may, if it please you,
perform or make it void at your pleasure, which I leave to your consideration,
not desiring to grieve you,
nor that you should be straitened in your mind or otherwise upon this account,
or bring yourself under upon any account, but as I have said,
it may be with great clearness.
So committing you, with myself, to the Lord, I take leave,
and remain your true and loving wife,

The 12th of the Second month, 1688.

The day she departed, several friends being there,
she desired them to be called together, and said, '`I have something to say,
if the Lord enable me.
As touching my burial, my dear husband being from home, it must be left to you;
and I desire there may be nothing of great preparation for the same;
though some may say it is covetousness, it matters not.
We have enough, but I am against gratifying the world`'s spirit;
for since I professed the truth,
I never had unity with superfluity at burials or marriages, especially at burials,
and have borne my testimony often against such things, as some of you are my witnesses;
and my dear husband is one with me,
and I know if such a thing should be at my burial it would grieve him,
who is gone upon truth`'s account, and I have freely given him up.
So if any Friend have anything to object, they may freely speak.`'

All Friends were one with her in that concern, and she further said,
'`I desire you may all keep in unity, and be of one mind.`'
She desired James Berry to make her coffin, being cheerful in her spirit;
and desired friends to remember her dear love to her dear husband,
and dear Daniel Gould and friends.
At another time she said to friends that were with her, '`Have your eyes to God,
whom I desire may support the little remnant that is left behind.
There are but a few, but the Lord is all-sufficient; and as you are faithful,
you will be preserved;
for indeed there are a few that have the weight of truth upon their spirits.
The Lord, if it be his will, raise up standard-bearers, and carry on his own work.`'

At another time she said,
'`Surely people had need have nothing to do at this time but to wait upon God,
when it shall please him to remove them; and if it be so with me,
O how will many do when their dying hour approaches!`' Then said, '`Lord, hasten your work,
for there is no ease upon this feather bed for my body,
but I shall be at ease when my body is laid in its cold bed of clay.`'
Some hour before she departed, she desired all friends to go to bed,
and took her leave of them, as if she was going to her long home, as indeed she was.
A little before she departed, the Lord gave her ease,
which she said she never expected in her body,
for which she praised the name of the Lord; so lay still afterwards,
and all was well with her, being freed from the pangs of death,
as appeared by her patient waiting the appointed time of the Lord,
as if she was slumbering.
In that quiet stillness she continued till she gave up the ghost,
and no doubt but she is blessed: as she lived in the Lord, she died in him,
and rests from her labors, and her good works follow her.

She had given many other heavenly exhortations, not noted, to several friends,
and to her youngest son, and others of her family, and several relations,
exhorting all to faithfulness, diligence, and true humility before the Lord.

Her age, the day of her death, and place of burial, I have no exact account of.

THOMAS FELL, late of Chapel-house, in the parish of Ireby, and county of Cumberland,
was convinced in the year 1653,
it being soon after the Lord had revealed his truth in the North;
and he was also the first married among Friends, at least in those parts.
Although he owned marriage as an ordinance of God,
yet he could not find in all the Holy Scriptures that God ever
appointed any of his priests or ministers to marry any,
or appointed they should have money for so doing;
yet he was cast into prison at Carlisle for not being married by a priest,
and giving him money.
There the said Thomas Fell remained prisoner one year,
and before he had his liberty his wife died.

Afterwards he was a prisoner nearly ten years at
the suit of one Edward Relf and Hugh Simpson,
impropriators, for not paying ten pence per year for tithes,
which they called prescription-money; for which he suffered cheerfully and with patience,
and never murmured.
After it pleased the Lord that he got his liberty clearly,
he travelled in the public service of truth, bearing testimony thereto,
freely preaching the gospel of Christ in England and Scotland,
and divine openings of heavenly things he had.
He was of a blameless life and conduct, and serviceable where he lived;
and as he grew in years, he grew in gravity and zeal for the Lord,
and for the promotion and prosperity of the great work the Lord has begun in the earth,
even to the day of his departure.

A friend visiting him near the hour of his departure, his memory was perfect,
and he said, '`Truth is as precious as ever,
for which I have been freely given up to suffer, labor, and travel,
both in our own country and in Scotland.`'
Indeed, he became as a pillar in the Lord`'s house, and when,
by reason of bodily weakness, he could not travel,
he was concerned that Friends might be kept in unity,
and walk in the fellowship of the gospel.
A little before his departure, he inquired whether they were in love one with another,
and if there were no rent or division;
and when it was reported to him that Friends were mostly well, and truth prospered,
he was comforted, and in great peace he departed this life in 1697,
in unity with the brethren, aged seventy-three years.

WILLIAM TOVEY, late of Henley-upon-Thames, Oxfordshire, malster,
was convinced of the blessed truth in his young days, and lived to a good old age,
and had many children, whom he had a care to train up in the way they should walk,
and therein he, through faithfulness, has found peace.
He was a just and religious man, careful to discharge his duty to Almighty God,
and to preserve his peace with him, through Jesus Christ his dear Son,
whom God has sent a light into the world, that all men through him might believe.
By that power, which through faith he received,
he was enabled to show a godly and exemplary conduct,
and therefore did adorn the doctrine of Christ our Savior,
and in the time of his bodily weakness was kept in a sweet and tender frame of spirit.

A few days before he departed out of this mortal life, his children being by him, he,
in sweetness and tenderness of spirit, said to them, '`Be faithful to the Lord,
and serve him in your generation.`'
And in particular, calling his son Caleb unto him, and taking him by the hand, said,
'`Dear Caleb, the Lord has a blessing in store for you, be faithful;`' and repeating it,
said, '`Be faithful,
and the Lord has a blessing in store for you;`' with more weighty expressions not noted;
and he added, '`I desire you may succeed in my place; but some may say,
you being but a young man, are too forward; mind it not, but be faithful,
and keep your eye to the Lord, and he will be your reward.`'
Then he said, '`Oh! that a young generation may be raised up in this place,
(Henley) if it be the will of the Lord, that may bear a faithful testimony to his truth,
his living truth.
I am not without hopes, though at present not very likely,
for there is a great deal of rubbish to be removed out of the way.`'
Adding, '`It is not high notions or a bare profession that will do, it is heart work.`'
Being asked to drink some cordial, he said,
'`It is my cordial to do the will of my God;`' adding,
'`I did not know I should have any thing to say; but it is the Lord`'s doing.`'
Then said to them present, '`Be not backward in going to meeting, and say,
we are hindered; no, no, that is the devil`'s work; but be valiant, miss no opportunity;
for as you are diligent in waiting upon the Lord,
that may be revealed to you at one time, that may not at another, or afterwards.`'

Speaking of the goodness of the Lord to the humble,
and how he guided those whose hearts are upright towards him, he said in much tenderness,
'`Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near:
let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,
and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God,
for he will abundantly pardon.`'
He then prayed tenderly and fervently to the Lord
for the prosperity of his truth in that place;
and expressed the satisfaction he had in discharging his duty in the sight of the Lord,
saying,
'`The quarterly-meeting was pleased to confer the
care of the church in this place upon me,`'
(i. e. he being desired to take care of the poor,
and to have an eye over the professors of truth there,
that they might walk as became their holy profession.)
'`I never did anything in an overly way.
No, no, but in humility and tenderness.
I watched over them for good, though I have been spurned at by some for it,
but the Lord forgive them.`'

He was preserved very sensible, and in greet patience all the time of his illness,
several times saying he had no clog upon him, but was freely given up, saying,
'`I am ready, come my Lord when you please, I am ready.`'
Another time he said,
'`The Lord does not withhold his living presence from me;`' so lifting up his hand again,
said, '`All is well, all is well, I am ready.`'
Near his departure, several of his children being by him, he looking upon them, said,
'`The Lord bless you all, the Lord bless you altogether,
and preserve you in his blessed truth until your last breath.`'
Giving order who should be invited to his funeral,
he said his end in desiring many should be there was for the salvation of their souls;
and if but one should be reached and come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved,
it would be well, and that which he desired.
Then said, '`I am wholly given up to the will of the Lord,
and I hope he will make my passage easy;`' and indeed
the Lord was pleased to answer his desire,
for he went away without sigh or groan, the year 1700, being seventy-seven years old.
He is entered into the joy of his Lord, and by faith, he being dead, yet speaks,
or is yet spoken of, as it is said of righteous Abel.
The weighty sayings following, being found of his own hand-writing,
some years after his decease, by his son Caleb, are here printed,
being worthy of observation.

'`Stand in awe of the living God, that created you to glorify his name.`'

[.offset]
'`Refrain from all evil, and love righteousness.`'

[.offset]
'`Do nothing that may bring dishonor to truth,
if the whole world might be gained thereby.`'

[.offset]
'`According to the ability or talents the Lord does give you inwardly or outwardly,
do you serve the Lord, his truth, and people.
Those that profess and possess the truth, that love it above all things,
that can venture all for truth`'s sake; such do you have true unity with,
but not with backbiters, or careless professors of truth.`'

[.offset]
'`If any difference does arise between Friends or others,
do you endeavor to put an end to it, in the spirit of meekness.
The rough nature is Esau, but the meek and lowly is the true seed.`'

[.offset]
'`Do justly, love to be merciful, that you may walk humbly with your God;
that when you have ended the days of your natural life,
you may lay down your head in peace with the living God; which far exceeds all the world,
or the world`'s enjoyments.
And in so doing, you will not only answer the requirings of the Lord,
but of your dear and tender father also.`'

WILLIAM BEVAN, of Swansea, in the county of Glamorgan, aged seventy-four years,
being sick and weak in body, and judging the time of his dissolution to be nigh,
said unto his son Silvanus Bevan, his daughter Hester being present,
'`I desire that you may live in love together when I am gone, and keep to meetings,
and let your houses be open to those that bring glad tidings of the kingdom of peace,
for they are faithful laborers, and if you have but little, God will add a blessing.`'
Being asked if he would take any thing to support his spirits, he refused, and said,
'`All is well, and that he saw no cloud of darkness before him, but blessed God,
that he had brought him into the inner court,
and if he had strength he could sing for joy;`' with many other comfortable expressions.
At another time when weak in bed, his son Michael, James Picton,
and kinsman William Bevan, and his son Silvanus Bevan, being present,
he said to this effect, '`Grandson William, be obedient to those you are under;
fear God always, and run not into the fashions of the world;
but behave yourself humbly and lowly, and God will add a blessing to your endeavors.
And son Michael, you know much, and God has given you much understanding.
You have a large memory of the Holy Scriptures; mind the gift of God`'s Holy Spirit,
and then you will be a good man, and a serviceable man,
and a preacher of righteousness in your life and conduct.`'

He also exhorted his sons to be kind to their sister,
and to honor and assist her in the choice of a husband,
that he might be one that fears God, and lives uprightly, and on all occasions; '`For,`'
said he, '`she has been careful and tender of me since your mother died,
and a support to my old age: so live in love together,
that others may behold you as a family of love, and then the Lord will bless you.`'
At another time, his son Silvanus, and many of his grandchildren being by his bedside,
he said, '`Fashion not yourselves after this world,
but transform yourselves to the image of the dear Son of God.
Be not puffed up in pride and gaudy apparel, but in the fear of God:
adorn yourselves modestly, as becomes Christians to do,
and keep to the small grain of the kingdom,
and then you will grow and flourish in holiness to the praise of God,
and lie down in peace, as you see me now.`'
And renewing his advice, of being a family of love when he was gone, said,
'`Strive not who shall be greatest,
but who shall be the humblest and most serviceable among you,
for that will be joy and peace in the Holy Ghost.
But an exalted mind brings pain and trouble; I know it.
If you will be careful and obedient to that small grain which God has sown in your hearts,
he will fulfill his promise; I am sure he will fulfill his promise,
and you will lie down in peace.
I have left something to every one of you.
If you do well, it will be a blessing, if not, a curse;
as the children of Israel desiring flesh, not obeying the Lord,
not content with their condition, God gave them flesh in his wrath,
and they died while it was between their teeth.
So to the Lord I leave you, desiring him to bless you,
which is the best portion I can give you.`'
His children all kissing him, concluded at this time in much tenderness and tears.

Many other comfortable expressions dropped from him, which were not taken in writing,
nor can it be justly remembered, importing tender advice and exhortation to his children,
showing forth greatly the joys of a peaceable conscience in our Lord Jesus Christ.
At another time, though very sick, and in much pain, about midnight,
on a sudden he was still and quiet, and in a little while said,
'`The Lord has removed the pains of death, his glory shines in his weak servant.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praises, praises be to him forever;`' with other good expressions,
and so continued singing a minute or two,
as one whom the Lord had assured of his salvation, and exalted above the fears of death,
or the terrors of the world to come, being supported by the spirit and power of religion,
which the agonies of death are not able to shake.
So having seen twenty of his children`'s children, and growing weaker and weaker in body,
he resigned up this life in that quietness and innocency in which infants go to sleep,
the 5th of the Twelfth month, 1701,
and was buried by his wife in Friends`' burying-place in Swansea.
This good old man, through faith and obedience in and to the Lord Jesus Christ,
and by a patient continuing in well-doing to the end,
has no doubt the reward of immortality, eternal life, and inherits glory, honor,
and peace with God in his holy, kingdom, and will do forever and ever.

NICHOLAS BEARD, of Rottingdean, in the county of Sussex, was in his youth a tender,
seeking young man after the knowledge of the Lord,
and for nearly twenty or thirty years would often ride many
miles to hear the best reputed teachers the times afforded.

In the year 1655 he was convinced of the blessed truth of God,
by the ministry of that eminent servant of Christ, George Fox,
and received it in the love thereof, and was faithful thereto.
It pleased the Lord to call him into the ministry,
and he labored in the work thereof in the county wherein he lived,
and the neighboring counties.
He was a constant attender of quarterly, monthly, and weekly meetings,
as long as strength of body would admit; and after that failed, that he could not go far,
continued visiting the nearest meetings, constant, sound in doctrine, fervent in prayer;
and to his children would often say, '`That which is right do, and the Lord be with you.`'
And in the sense of the Lord`'s goodness, would often say, '`Be bowed before the Lord,
oh! my soul.`'
Growing weak in body, being in his chamber, and some of his children with him,
with lifted up hands and eyes, he said, '`I must leave you to the teachings of the Lord,
and the Lord in mercy be with you.`'
Being weak in his bed, in melody of spirit, he was heard to say, '`Oh!
Lord, my soul blesses you, and all that is within me magnifies your holy name.`'
He often desired to depart, and be with Christ in peace,
which he also signified would be his portion in the world to come.
So departed this life, in peace with the Lord and unity with the brethren,
the 2nd of the Fifth month, 1702,
having ordained in his will that his executor should entertain his friends,
the people called Quakers, in his house, as he in his lifetime did: aged eighty years;
a minister about thirty years.

To show that he was not only called to believe, but also to suffer,
I shall briefly recite some of his sufferings.

For his testimony against paying tithes in this gospel-day,
he had taken from him by one Robert Baker, priest of Rottingdean,
for one year`'s tithes demanded, twelve oxen, six cows, and one bull,
which were sold the same day at Lewis-clift fair
for one hundred and eleven pounds five shillings;
but worth more.

For the worship of God, or meeting only for that end,
and keeping the testimony of a good conscience, in obeying Christ`'s command,
"`Swear not at all,`" and abiding in his doctrine, and for not bearing arms,
or sending out in the militia, and not frequenting the public worship,
he was prosecuted on the statute of twenty pounds per month, and underwent imprisonment,
and sustained the loss of his goods, and many other abuses.
Yet it pleased the Lord to support and bless him;
so that although his loss was more than one thousand pounds,
and his charge of children considerable, being the father of above twenty,
yet he gave them that lived good portions, being twelve;
also lived to see several of them well settled in the world,
leaving his youngest son in his own seat,
in a much more plentiful estate than his parents left him,
though he was a prisoner several years.

ELIZABETH HOPKINS, wife of Thomas Hopkins, of Glastonbury, in Somersetshire, loved truth,
and those that were faithful to it, although she was but young in it;
and when taken sick was not discontented, but resigned to the will of God.
Being asked whether she was willing to die, she said, '`I am fitted to die,
and fully satisfied.
I find nothing in my way that hinders me from peace with the Lord;`' and lay often
praising the Lord for his great lovingkindness and mercy to her,
in bringing her to the knowledge of the truth.
Towards her end, she said, '`Lord,
make my passage out of this world easy;`' which he was pleased to grant,
and she passed away like a lamb, or one going to sleep.
She departed in true and living faith, the 16th of the Sixth month, 1703,
after several months`' weakness, and was buried in Friends`' burying-ground at Glastonbury.

JOHN BEERE, of Weymouth, in the county of Dorset,
was born of believing parents in the year 1659,
and when he grew up he embraced the same faith,
and professed truth in much plainness and sincerity, and was, through the power of it,
of a blameless conduct, a good example, and of great service in the church.

In the year 1693, being about thirty-four years of age,
he received a gift of the ministry, in which he was a faithful laborer,
though he did not travel far, but had good service in his own country,
and was well beloved and esteemed by his friends and near neighbors,
to whom he administered much tender and wholesome advice.
In his last sickness, two days before he died, he sent for a friend and neighbor, who,
when he came, asked him how he did; he replied, '`I have but one pain to encounter with,
that is the pain of my body, for my mind is at ease.`'
And at another visit of the same friend he repeated the same.
The day that he departed there were several friends and others to visit him,
to whom he gave seasonable advice, desiring them to be faithful, saying,
'`Although you are few in number,
if you continue faithful the Lord will increase you;`' and desired
them to make their peace with the Lord in the time of their health,
for on a deathbed they would have enough to do to struggle with the pain of the body;
for he said if he had not made his peace with the
Lord before he came on a dying-bed he had been miserable.
Another time, his eldest daughter asking how he did, he said,
'`I am waiting for my change;`' and desired his children to be obedient to their mother,
and keep out of all evil company.
Many were the seasonable and comfortable expressions which he gave
forth in the time of his weakness that cannot be remembered.
He died the 5th of the Seventh month, 1703.
Aged forty-four years; a minister ten years.

SARAH SCOTT, daughter of Francis Scott, of Hambridge, in the county of Somerset,
aged four days short of thirteen years,
was educated in the way of truth professed by the people called Quakers,
from the age of three years, by her uncle and aunt Whiting, who took her as their own.
She was of a loving and affable temper, and sober behavior, but of a weakly constitution,
not given or addicted to any bad words or actions; yet, when she came upon a sick bed,
it seemed hard sometimes for her to be reconciled to her sickness.
But upon reading several places in the New Testament,
concerning afflictions and chastisements, as Heb.
xii., etc., she came to be reconciled to both, and afterward received great satisfaction,
so that her heart was often enlarged in the love of God,
and her soul did magnify the God of her salvation.

Her uncle, J. Whiting, asked her if she was willing to die; she said,
'`If I had assurance of the love of God, I should.`'
Then he asked her if she had any thing that lay upon her mind that troubled her.
She answered no, nothing in particular, but that she had lived no better,
or more circumspectly; but upon his mentioning to her the mercy of God in Christ Jesus,
who died for her, she said, '`If it be the will of God to take me to himself,
I am content.`'
She frequently prayed in secret to the Lord; and once, being spoken to when still,
she said, '`Let me alone, that I may meditate on my God;`' and afterward said,
she enjoyed the streams of the love of God, but found the enemy so busy,
that it is hard to keep my mind stayed on the Lord;`' adding,
she was sorry for all that did live wickedly,
and lamented what many would do when they came upon a deathbed;
and desired her aunt to advise one of her acquaintance to take more
care of her words and actions, or she would find it hard when she came upon a deathbed.

She said, '`I have had much trouble, the enemy having been busy, when I was in meetings,
so that I looked out sometimes, and neglected the inward work,
for which I have known sorrow.
I have gone through nights of sorrow and prayer; but now I am made willing to die.
I shall go to a glorious place, where there is no temptation nor sorrow,
and where all tears shall be wiped from the eyes;`' adding,
'`My spirit is comforted in the love of God, and if I had lived more in the fear of God,
I should have been more comforted.
The Lord has been good to me, I am willing to die; it seemed hard to me sometimes,
yet now it is made easy.`'
And said, '`All must be humbled, and brought low, one time or other.
They must bow; if they will not bow in mercy, they must in judgment.`'
Adding, '`It is well for me that I have been afflicted;
else I might not have known the things that belong to my peace;
but now I cannot say I do not know them, for I do now see them, and rejoice in them.`'

Next morning she expressed a concern for a near relation,
desiring that she might live in the fear of God, saying,
"`The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.`"
She lamented those that live in pride, and spend much time in adorning the body,
and walking wantonly.
After, she magnified the Lord`'s goodness, saying, '`The Lord is a gracious God,
and of great mercy and righteousness, and I trust in him.`'
She prayed very devoutly, and implored the Lord`'s mercy,
and praised him for his goodness, and gave good advice to those present,
particularly to the party afore hinted, saying, '`Be careful of your words and carriage,
especially in meetings, to keep in your mind,
for God is to be worshipped in spirit and truth,
and that God had given her a measure of his grace,
that she should serve him while she was in health, for when she came to a sick-bed,
and in pain, it would be harder.`'
After, she said, '`Remember my love to all Friends that ask for me;`' and then prayed,
saying, '`O! Lord Jesus, receive my soul, if it be your heavenly will.
O! Lord, I am truly resigned to your will.
O! Lord Jesus, come quickly, if it be your heavenly will; and!
Lord, make my passage easy.
O Lord! send your angel to conduct me to your heavenly kingdom.
O Lord! you are beautiful.
O Lord! hear my prayer, and grant me my request, if it be your heavenly will.
Give me power over the enemy; he is a cunning enemy, a subtle serpent.
O Lord! keep me from his temptations, who lays his baits at every corner.`'

Again she said, '`There is nothing to be compared to your love;
all the world is but as a fading flower!
What will it avail a man,
to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul.
O! what need have people to go with their heads so high,
when they must all be laid in the dust.
O Lord! you are sweet, your countenance is comely.
O Lord! how have you refreshed me many a time, after I have prayed to you.
O! that you wouldest crown me with glory.`'
And said, '`O! that we may all meet again in the kingdom of heaven.`'
After, she said, '`O Lord Jesus! there is none like unto you,
the author and finisher of our faith, to help, and none else can.`'

The day before she died, she said, '`O Lord! you are the great physician of value,
the heavenly physician, who can do that which none else can.
You can raise from the dead.
Speak the word, and it shall be done.
You are a gracious God, and of great mercy, and full of righteousness.
Your mercies deserve to be had in everlasting remembrance,
from the beginning of the world, to the end thereof.
O! Lord Jesus, you have tendered my spirit, and humbled my soul.
Your works are too wonderful to be +++[+++fully]
spoken of;`' with many other heavenly expressions.
In the evening, her relations thinking she had been departing,
after some time she looked up, and said, '`Pray for me.`'
Her uncle Bowles being present, found a concern upon him to pray to the Lord for her.
Then she said to her aunt,
'`Do not grieve when I am gone;`' and desired her the
next time the Lord did visit her in that manner,
not to disturb her.
That night she took her leave of all who were about her, in a very solemn manner,
taking them by the hand, and bidding them farewell; and after, said to her aunt,
'`Now I am just a going,`' and said, '`Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.
Into your hands I render my soul.`'
Her aunt Bowles coming in, asked her how it was with her; she answered,
'`Very well;`' which were her last words,
and in a few minutes passed away without sigh or groan, on the 27th of the Eighth month,
1703.
Aged four days short thirteen years.
She was buried the 30th of the same, from Bull and Mouth meetinghouse,
at Friends`' burying-ground, near Bunhill-fields, London.

WILLIAM FENNELL, aged about twelve years, son of William Fennell of Youghall in Ireland,
shop-keeper, took to his bed the 24th of the 12th month, 1703,
the Lord having visited him about two years before,
and often followed him with the reproofs and convictions of his Holy Spirit,
when he had sometimes been wild, and run to play among other children.
When he was brought on his sick bed, not many days after,
he was under an inward exercise of mind, and desired his mother to read by him.
Another time he desired to have the ten commandments read to him; which were,
and he was asked how far he found he had kept them.
He answered he had not, as he could remember, ever taken the Lord`'s name in vain,
and that he loved and honored his father and mother,
and had been careful not to tell lies or false stories on any one,
nor had he stolen any thing, except taking some plums without asking leave,
and hoped the Lord would pass it by, with what else he had done amiss.
Remaining very weak, he was asked if he was willing to die; he answered,
'`If I thought I was fit.`'

The 3rd of the First month, two English friends being in town,
he desired they might have a meeting in the chamber with him; which they had,
and he afterwards expressed his satisfaction therein;
and then he broke forth in much trembling, saying,
'`Lord! forgive all my faults that I have done, and have mercy and pity on my poor soul.
Keep out the enemy that is ready to come in upon me, for none but you,
O Lord! is able to do it;`' with much more.
He then called for his sisters and brother, and exhorted them to love and fear God,
and pray to him to fit them to die, and to love truth, and to go to meetings,
and to think upon God and good things, and the Lord would love them.
He bade them do what their father and mother bid them, and be obedient to them,
and look in their bibles,
and they would find it was God`'s command to children to obey their parents,
for it is well pleasing to the Lord.

To one of his companions, being near, namely Edward Lawndry, he said,
'`Do you think you are fit to die?
If you think you are not, then pray to the Lord, and desire him to make you fit,
and do not mind play too much;`' saying he was sorry he had so long,
but he hoped the Lord would forgive him.
Lying still some time, being under a concern of mind, he was asked what his concern was.
After some pause he answered,
'`I am desiring the Lord to bring me in with the rest
of his lost sheep;`' with more to that purpose,
saying, '`I have cried unto him many a night, since I have been not well;
for I have been a wild boy, and loved play too well,
and when you have sometimes corrected me, I took it a little hard;
but now I am glad you did, and I cannot express the love I now have for you,
for taking that care of me.
You did well; had you not done it, I might have been wilder; for,`' said he,
'`the Lord has been following me, and striving with me, to bring me down these two years,
and let me see when I have been running to play, if I continued running on to be wild,
then weeping, wailing, and lamentation would be my portion.

'`Sometimes I have turned back, and have gone into the garret and wept bitterly,
and have desired the Lord to help me; but after, when enticed by my comrades to go,
I was not able to resist the temptations, which was my great trouble,
and I have got into a secret place to endeavor to retire,
and often have prayed to the Lord in the night-season on my knees,
when others have been asleep.`'
This child cried out, saying, '`Oh! the Lord loves solitariness,
he does not love laughing and joking; I never read that Christ smiled,
but often prayed and wept.`'
Then he prayed, '`O Lord! hear me, and have pity on me;
for you know I am very sorely afflicted.
Lord help me.
Oh! it is none but you that can do it, Lord.
O Lord! be near me, and allow not the enemy to prevail over me.`'
Speaking of the Lord`'s prayer, this child said,
'`I have much lamented how people teach their children the Lord`'s prayer,
without minding the depth that is in it, saying,
"`Our Father who art in heaven;`" but they that remain in wickedness are not his children,
so cannot rightly call him Father.
"`Hallowed be your name;`" but too many dishonor it by their wicked words.
"`Your kingdom come:`" Oh! but too few let the Lord live and have dominion in them.
"`Your will be done in earth, that is,`' said he, '`in our earthen body.
"`As it is done in heaven;`" and alas! we all know
there is nothing but the will of God done there:
oh! but how little of the Lord`'s will is done here.
"`Give us this day our daily bread:`" O Lord,`' said he, '`give me daily bread from you.
"`Forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive them that trespass against us;`" but oh! how unwillingly
do many people forgive them that trespass against them.
How can such expect forgiveness of the Lord?
"`Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.`"`' Then he said,
'`Oh! leave me not in temptation, but deliver me from the tempter;
for yours is the kingdom, and all power is with you, and glory forever.
This prayer,`' said he, '`people teach their children by heart, and think it is enough.
I have been at play with a boy in the street, and his father has called to him, saying,
"`Have you said your prayers today?`"
and he has gone in from me, and stood behind the door,
and has said this prayer as fast as he could, for haste to go to play again.
I hearkened to him all the while.`'

Such careless ones he lamented; and he gave good advice to many that came to him,
and advised the servant-maid against speaking bad words;
and though his breath grew short, he said,
'`I desire to please the Lord always;`' and so continued in a wonderful manner.
He was very resigned to the will of the Lord,
and desired his parents to give him up freely, and then took his leave,
in great tenderness, of his father, mother, sisters, and brother, and relations;
desiring to have his love remembered to his grandmother,
and some other relations and friends that were not present.
Pausing, he said, '`Oh! what joy I feel!`' praising the Lord, while strength remained,
till near the minute of his departure, and resigning himself to the Lord.
His last words heard were, '`O Lord!`' What followed could not be understood,
his breath failing, and so sweetly departed, being the 14th of the First month, 1704.
Aged twelve years and a half, and two days.
He kept his bed about eighteen days.

SARAH SOUNDY, wife of William Soundy, of Reading, and daughter of William Tovey,
of Henley-upon-Thames, in Oxfordshire, was trained up in the fear of God,
and when on her deathbed,
she breathed forth in an extraordinary manner praises to the Lord; and said,
'`The Lord is a merciful God.
I find him so to my soul.
He spreads a table for his children, and the dainties he sets thereon,
and his children feed thereat.
He honors me with his presence, and that is favor enough.
As for this world, it is but a bubble.
I would not change my condition for any of yours,`' meaning those then by her bedside,
'`although I might have my health; for I can never be better satisfied to die,
than now I am;`' with many more heavenly expressions,
which she delivered one day after another; which were not noted.
She farther said, '`What have I done that the Lord should be so good to me?
Many have been great sufferers; but I have done nothing;
so that if I have but the least place in the kingdom, I shall be satisfied,
although it be but a door-keeper.`'

She died the 24th of the Twelfth month, 1703, at Ridge,
and was buried in Friends`' burying-ground in Henley-upon-Thames,
the 28th of the Twelfth month, 1703.

MARY STUBS, daughter of Thomas Stubs, belonging to Pardshaw meeting in Cumberland,
came of believing parents, by whom she was educated in the way of truth,
and reached thereby in her young years, walking circumspectly, as becomes the truth.
She received a public testimony seven years before her death,
and visited friends in Northumberland, some part of Bishopric, Yorkshire,
and Lancashire, and friends generally in the nation of Ireland, and was well received.
When visited with sickness, she was borne up in her spirit;
and when her mother seemed to be troubled and sorry to part with her,
she desired her to be content, for it was her great joy, and farther said,
'`I see nothing that I have to do but die.`'
She also said, '`I am fully clear,`'
and so departed very sensibly the 11th of the Twelfth month, 1704,
in the thirty-third year of her age,
and was buried in Friends`' burying-place at Eaglesfield.

AMBROSE RIGGE, late of Ryegate, in Surry, was born at Banton, in Westmoreland,
and convinced of the truth about the year 1652.
Being called of God to preach the gospel of peace and salvation,
he was drawn to visit London, and the south and west parts of England,
about the year 1655, enduring great hardships, being often imprisoned in jails,
not for evil-doing, but preaching the truth.
For refusing to swear, in obedience to Christ, who commanded,
"`Swear not at all,`" he was premunired, and made prisoner at Horsham, in Sussex,
above ten years at one time.
He was also whipped, and often evilly entreated and abused,
which he bore with much patience, and continued faithful unto death.
In the time of his sickness, wherein he died,
he had great assurance of the mercy and favor of God, and said,
'`I am going where the weary are at rest.`'
He bore his sickness with much patience; and a little before his departure, he declared,
saying, '`If friends keep to the root of life in themselves,
they would be the happiest people in the world.`'

He departed this life the 30th of the Eleventh month, 1704,
and was buried the 4th of the Twelfth month in Friends`' burying-ground at Ryegate,
in Surry.
Aged above seventy, and a minister about forty-nine years.

GEORGE FOOKS, late of Gray`'s-Inn-lane, in the parish of Andrew`'s, Holborn,
in the county of Middlesex, shoemaker, was born at Boston, in Cambridgeshire,
in the year 1649, and religiously inclined from his youth.
He was convinced of the blessed truth, as professed by the people called Quakers,
with whom he joined in society about the age of one-and-twenty;
and by believing in Christ the true light,
he came to receive power to walk inoffensively; and though he could not then read,
he afterwards learned to read the Holy Scriptures, and greatly delighted therein.
When he came to have a family, he was careful to have them frequently read therein;
and would direct those of his family to that Holy Spirit in themselves,
which the Scripture testifies of,
that thereby they might come to have an understanding of them,
and find help in themselves to withstand evil, and to be preserved out of it.
He cautioned them also against evil,
and exhorted them to that which was good and well-doing.

He was a man of a tender heart and meek spirit, pitiful to the poor,
and faithful to the Lord,
who was pleased to give him a part in the ministry of the word of life,
about the year 1691, and he travelled some time in the work thereof,
and was serviceable for several years, while he enjoyed his health.

In the year 1704 it pleased the Lord to visit him with sore affliction of body,
which he bore with much patience;
and in the time of his weakness had many visits from his friends and neighbors,
being well beloved by them.
When some came to visit him, and said, '`The Lord comfort you,`' he answered,
'`The Lord is with me, and is my comfort night and day,
and has made my bed easier than I could think.
Although the Lord has been pleased to afflict my body, yet he comforts my soul;
as he has taken away the strength of my limbs,
he has preserved my senses to praise him.`'

Before he died he called his son, and bade him read the 5th, 6th,
and 7th chapters of Matthew, and then observed to him the blessings mentioned therein,
and said to him, '`You have a privilege beyond many poor children,
I would not have you slight it; but read them often,
and desire the Lord to open your understanding in what you read, for it is for our help;
and as you do so, I do believe the Lord will help you, as he did me.
My concern is for your soul`'s good, which is of greater value than your body.`'
Then he added, '`The Lord has blessed my honest endeavors and labors hitherto;
so that you have been fed and clothed with the rest of my children and family,
and I have something to spare.
But the greatest blessing the Lord has blessed me with, is the knowledge of his truth;
and you have often heard me say, +++[+++desire]
that whatever the Lord should be pleased to bereave me of,
he would be pleased to keep me in the sense of this blessing;
and at this time I have a living sense thereof;
with earnest desires to the Lord it may be so with you.
My dear child, I am going out of this world, and must leave you,
and you will lose a tender father; but as you do mind the Lord, and think upon him,
he will be a father to you, as he was to me.
Be sure you be kind and loving to your mother, and be ruled by her when I am gone;
and remember what I have said to you,
and keep the commandments of the Lord in your lifetime,
and it will be well with you hereafter, and then you will not be afraid to die.
For your sake I could have been willing to stay longer here, but it must not be,
and I am willing to submit to the will of the Lord; for it is well, it is well,
or I would not have told you so.
I am not afraid to die.
Once more I bid you remember your father`'s dying words.`'
He said also to his son,
'`I never kept back the wages of any man that did any thing for me,
nor ever over-reached any man in dealing, nor ever wronged any man one penny.`'

Then desiring to see his daughter, she came.
He said unto her, '`My child, you were my first-born, and the child of my love;
but you have grieved me to the heart, and grieved the Lord,
and many friends that wished you well.
I am now going out of this world, and when my trouble ends, yours may begin.
I do forgive you, and desire the Lord to pass by and forgive you.
I do forgive you, and I hope and believe he will;
but you must be very diligent in seeking and crying to him.
You are now a mother of children; be sure to be a good example to them,
teach them to read the Scriptures, and do you so too;
quit yourself to your husband as a woman fearing God should.
Be loving to your mother, and she will be loving to you and yours I know.
I have seen your condition, and considered it; the Lord bless you, is my earnest desire.
Think upon my dying words when I am gone; they may do you good.
I have been a tender father to you: so hereafter you may say.
Oh! wife, how has been and is my soul ravished with joy.
I cannot express the joy my soul has been in this night.
Oh! wife, it is well; do not be troubled for me, for it is well;
and as we keep close to the Lord it will be well.`'

This is the account which he gave in the time of his sickness;
though he sometimes met with exercises, the Lord was with him, and stood by him,
for he was an honest man, and so lived and died,
and no doubt is at rest in the paradise of God.

He died the 27th of the Eighth month, 1704, aged about fifty-five,
convinced about thirty-four, and a minister about thirteen years.
He was decently and honorably buried, being accompanied by his relations,
and many friends, to their burying-place near Bunhill-fields.

ANNE TRUSS was born at Reading, where she received the truth,
and suffered imprisonment for her testimony to it.
She was well esteemed, being a woman who loved truth,
and was zealously given up to promote its honor,
and encouraged faithfulness among the professors of it, both by exhortation and example.
She was often concerned in public to speak of the goodness of God, in Christ Jesus,
to mankind, from a sense and taste thereof,
and pressed to diligence in the worship of God, and holiness of life:
and life and power attended her testimony.
She often desired her last sickness might not be long;
and it was indeed but about four days, and in that time she counseled her friends,
neighbors, and grandchildren, who came to see her, and were with her,
to prize their precious time, and to keep out of everything that would offend the Lord,
and said, '`My peace is made with the Lord.`'
She prayed with much sweetness for her grandchildren,
and that the Lord would destroy all that in his people which was contrary to himself.
A few hours before she departed, she said, '`I now hope I shall be at rest.`'

She died the 17th of the First month, 1704.
Aged seventy-six years.

HUMPHREY WOOLBRIDGE was convinced of truth early, and received a public testimony for it;
he travelled pretty much about England in the service of truth, and wrote several books.
About the year 1705, being at London, he was taken ill,
and continued so some time at Friends`' work-house near Clerkenwell,
being troubled with a great swelling in his face and mouth,
which much deprived him of his speech.
But he wrote several times to Friends, that the Lord was good to him,
and desired Friends to pray for him, saying, '`I see a farther weight of glory,
into which I am not entered.`'
Another time, '`My love in the Lord is to you; my present thought is, to die is my gain,
without doubt; because the love and mercy of God, that casts out fear,
is shed in my heart, to whom I bow my knee, and bless his holy name, his gracious name.`'

In the Fifth month, a little before his death, he wrote to some Friends in London thus:
'`The Lord is my rock, and my salvation and tower, in the time of my distress and anguish.
I cried to the Lord when the billows went over my head,
and the proud waves did afflict my soul.
Then was my faith in God, and underneath was the everlasting arm, my salvation.
So that with David I could say, '`The Lord sits upon the floods,
he reigns as king forever and ever.`"

He died the 31st of the Fifth month, 1707.
Aged about seventy-four years.

WILLIAM HARRIS, of Radford-seemly, in the county of Warwick,
was one who received the Truth in the love of it, in his youthful days,
and being faithful, a part of the gospel ministry was given to him;
in which he labored with zeal and fervency of spirit.
He was very serviceable in doctrine and discipline,
serving truth and Friends in singleness of heart; seeking much the prosperity of truth,
and the love and unity of Friends in it.
He was fervent and frequent in admonition and exhortation
to all people where his lot was cast;
always having a regard to the fear of the Lord unto the last,
and very honorable for his innocent life and upright conduct, wherein he walked,
as a true pattern of virtue; ruling well his own house,
and keeping his family in good order, wherein he was exemplary,
often calling upon them to love and fear the Lord,
and to wait together upon the Lord in his own family.
And with much diligence, and due order to frequent their public meetings,
wherein his love and faithfulness were manifest to the last.

He was taken ill in a meeting which Joseph Bains
had appointed in the public meetinghouse at Harbury,
on the 18th of the Seventh month, 1705, but sat the meeting; and after;
he was well satisfied in the will of the Lord being done, for he was not afraid to die.
Being something better, he went home, and grew weaker: but the Lord enabled him,
on the 23rd of the Seventh month, being First-day,
to go to the meeting of Friends at Harbury,
and publicly declare the word of truth with much fervency, both to Friends and others;
and after meeting hastened home, and grew weaker and weaker in body.
On the 3rd of the Eighth month, a Friend went to visit him, to whom he said,
the night before had been very comfortable to him, for the Lord gave him sweet repose,
so that he felt no pain.
The Lord was so large in his love to him,
that he showed him that the walls of salvation were about him,
and that he would give him an entrance into everlasting life.

On the 6th of the same month he was taken so ill that it
was thought he would scarcely live till morning.
When a Friend came to see him next morning, he was a little revived,
and spoke comfortably to him and those present.
The next day the Friend came again to see him; and when he came into the chamber,
he put forth his hand, and took him by the hand, saying,
'`You are come to see me this once more.
I am now a dying man; I wait to be dissolved; I am weary of this frail body.
When the Lord pleases, I would be freed from it.`'
Several Friends coming to see him, he spoke very sensibly to them;
and when they took their leave, he exhorted them to fear the Lord,
and be faithful in the truth.
A Friend who was related to him, taking his leave of him, seemed to be troubled; he said,
'`Make no ado, neither be troubled, it is the Lord`'s doing.`'
He exhorted his elder servant to fear the Lord,
and charged her to exhort her fellow servant to fear him also, saying,
'`Without it the heart will not be kept clean.`'

A friend said to him, '`You have been a comfort to many,
I hope the Lord will remember you in his mercy,
and be a comfort to you in this your affliction.`'
He answered, '`The Lord is good to my soul.
I can say, I have fought the good fight of faith, I am now finishing my course;
the Lord will give me a crown of life.`'
A little before he departed, he signified his great love to all friends in general,
and said, '`My love is to all my friends and old acquaintance.`'
A friend observing his exercise, said, '`You have hard labor;`' he said,
'`The Lord will visit me in his mercy,
and give me an easy passage in his own time out of this body.`'
And so he did, and he entered into stillness, lay the space of an hour,
and quietly and peaceably departed, as a lamb going into his rest,
about the 12th hour at night, the 7th of the Eighth month, 1705,
aged about seventy years.

GILBERT LATEY, an ancient professor of the holy truth, was born in the parish of Issey,
in the county of Cornwall, in the year 1626, and came to London in the year 1648.
He was of a sober conduct and religiously inclined,
and followed those that were esteemed the most religious preachers at that time.
About the year 1654, he was,
by the spirit of Christ and the powerful preaching of that eminent servant of the Lord,
Edward Burrough, convinced of the blessed truth,
as it is professed by the people called Quakers,
at a meeting held at the house of Sarah Matthews, in Whitecross-street, London,
in the year 1654.
In the year 1659 he was concerned to bear a public testimony for truth,
and against superfluity; and being by trade a tailor, would not meddle with,
nor allow his servants to put upon apparel, to set it off, any superfluities,
as lace and ribbons.

He was also concerned to solicit, with other friends, the several powers in his time,
for suffering friends, and used to say friends should keep to truth,
or the anointing in their solicitations, and then they might expect a blessing,
and be made serviceable.

And in the year 1705, the seventy-fourth year of his age, being weak,
he said he had done the work of his day faithfully, and was set down in the will of God,
and there was no cloud in his way.
The night before he departed, he gave counsel to those that were in the room,
to fear the Lord, and not to do evil for evil, but to do good for evil; for there is,
said he, no overcoming of evil, but in and by that which is good.
Exhorting much to love and tenderness,
saying the Lord would bless such as were found therein.
A few hours before his departure,
he said that there was no condemnation to them that were in Christ Jesus, '`for,`' said he,
'`he is the lifter up of my head, he is my strength and great salvation.`'

He departed this life the 15th of the Ninth month, 1705,
and was buried in Friends`' burying-ground, at Kingston-upon-Thames.

WILLIAM STOVEY, late of Helperston Marsh, near Trowbridge, in the county of Wilts,
was born at Aberry in the said county.
He received truth as it is professed by the people called Quakers,
upon its first publication in those parts,
and was a very zealous encourager of faithfulness among Friends.
He also received a gift of the ministry,
and was often very much concerned in his travels,
that truth`'s testimony might be kept up in its several branches,
and particularly against the anti-christian oppression of tithes.
For bearing this testimony, as well as keeping up meetings, he was a great sufferer,
being cast into several prisons, and had his cattle, and other goods,
several times taken from him, even to the bed he lay on,
and almost all that was thought worth removing.
His last sickness was not very great in appearance, nor long;
yet he signified he should never go forth of his chamber, and said,
'`I can and do forgive all my enemies.`'
He was very cheerful in the time of his illness,
and more than ordinarily glad of friends`' company that came to see him,
and said he was satisfied and willing, when the Lord pleased, to leave this world,
in expectation of a far greater happiness in that which is to come.

He departed this life the 7th of the Eleventh month, 1705, and was buried at Cummerell,
in the said county.

ELIZABETH DICKINSON, widow, was convinced in her husband`'s lifetime;
though her husband was concerned thereat, and she met with great exercise;
yet was made willing to give up, to answer the requirings of truth, and in a little time,
through the grace of God bestowed upon her, being faithful to the Lord,
she was made a publisher of the everlasting gospel of Christ Jesus,
being well nigh the first, in Abby-holme meeting.
The Lord added to her days, and the number of the church;
that she lived not only to see many gathered to the Lord in her time,
but many also raised to bear a public testimony for him, to the gladdening of her heart,
in the thirty years she lived after she received the truth.
She was of a blameless life and conduct, living answerable to the doctrine of Christ.
She loved the unity of good people,
and hated that which was the cause of the breach thereof.
She was never tedious in her testimony.
She was a mother in Israel, a terror to evil doers,
and bore a faithful testimony against the workers of iniquity.
She ruled well her own house; so that her advice and counsel took place with others.
She was endued by the Lord with meekness and wisdom,
and was freely given up to serve the truth with what she had, and the Lord blessed her.
She visited Friends in Northumberland, Bishopric, Westmoreland, Yorkshire,
and Lancashire, where she had good service for the Lord.
And in the year 1688 she visited Friends in Scotland, and had also good service,
the Lord accompanying her with his heavenly power and presence.

In the time of her sickness, though very sharp, the Lord preserved her in patience,
and she desired friends to remember her in their near approaches to the Lord, and said,
'`Lord, I am willing to die.
You who have made me willing, are able to make me ready.
Look down upon your afflicted handmaid, and lay no more upon me than I am able to bear.`'
She often desired the Lord to be near,
and her last words that can be remembered before she departed, were,
'`You Lord God of Israel,
be near and fasten my spirit;`' which it is not doubted but he was pleased to do,
and received her into rest with the righteous, where no disturbance can come;
but praises everlasting are sung to the Lord God and the Lamb forevermore.

She departed this life the eighth of the Eleventh month, 1705,
in the sixty-sixth year of her age, and was buried at Friends`' burying-place at Allonby,
upon the sea-coast in Cumberland, being accompanied with many friends and relations.

SARAH BLACKHOUSE, of Yeoland-Redman, in the county of Lancaster,
was convinced of the truth,
by receiving the testimony of that eminent messenger and minister of the gospel of Christ,
George Fox, in the year 1653, being in and about the twenty-seventh year of her age.
Within a few years after, it pleased the Lord to concern her in a public testimony,
to the refreshing and edifying of his churches and people,
in which she faithfully labored and travelled in the meetings whereunto she belonged,
and some other adjacent meetings.
She was exemplary in her life and conduct, and preached truth therein to her neighbors,
and those she was concerned with.

A few days before she died, her friends and relations being by her bedside, she said,
'`See that in all your meetings you wait upon the Lord, and be not sleepy.
Be faithful to what he has made known, and revealed to you:
for it need not be said to you, know the Lord; you know enough,
be faithful to what the Lord has revealed, for that is the sum of all religion.`'
A little after she said, '`I am weak, and in much pain, I desire to be eased,
when the Lord`'s pleasure is; through mercy he has given me peace and rest to my soul.`'
She then said, '`Farewell, fare you all well in the Lord,
I desire your growth and prosperity in the truth, every one for yourselves.`'

JOHN TOMKINS, who collected the three volumes of Dying Sayings, formerly printed,
entitled, Piety Promoted, was born about the year 1663,
and his honest parents were in society with the people called Quakers.

His father died when he was very young,
after which his mother took care to have him religiously educated,
and the Lord blessed her care,
and was graciously pleased in his tender years to incline him to love and fear him.
He was an obedient son, and assisting to her in her business; and as he grew in years,
continued so.

When his mother married again, she had several more children by her second husband.
And after she died, and her husband was reduced to a very low condition,
this his son-in-law was both tender and charitable,
and had a great care and regard to his children.
As his love and tender compassion began to be early manifested to his relations,
so did his love greatly appear to those who preached the gospel of Christ,
and to the poor and afflicted in body and mind, whom he relieved, visited, and comforted.
He also greatly loved and delighted in the Holy Scriptures,
and diligently read and searched them.
As he grew in years, he grew in grace,
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; and being faithful to the Lord,
he was pleased to put him into the ministry,
and committed to him the word of reconciliation,
and made him a skillful minister for his time, in the word of life;
so that he could divide it aright.

He was filled with such a holy zeal for the name and truth of God,
as was accompanied with knowledge, and was well acquainted with our Christian discipline,
and careful that it might be maintained,
greatly desiring where any professing truth walked not according to it,
that they might be admonished and reproved;
and that the works and ways of those who would not receive either,
but continued loose and unfaithful, should be testified against,
that friends might be clear, and the church and Zion of God might shine.
He greatly delighted in her prosperity, and travailed for her welfare,
and prayed that the Lord would favor her dust, and satisfy her poor with bread,
and comfort all her mourners.
One asking him how he did, he replied, '`Very weak, but I am willing to die,
and leave this troublesome world, if the Lord sees it meet to remove me at this time.`'

Lying on his bed very weak, he declared to friends then present,
very fervently for some time, concerning the work of the Lord,
and the prosperity of his truth in the earth; and in particular,
that the Lord would have a glorious church and people, when all the dross and chaff,
that did yet cleave to them, should be purged out, and blown away.
That the Lord would remove that which had been the
occasion of any disunion among his people,
and bring them more and more into unity, and to be of one heart and mind,
and that the work of the Lord should go forward in the earth,
and his truth prosper over all the kingdoms of it,
and many nations should be gathered to it.
He also said, '`I believe the Lord will bless his people,
and carry on the work he has begun in the earth.
It is my faith,
that the time will come that the wicked shall be as few as the righteous are now;
but there is much to be purged out of the church;
there is much pride and superfluity to be done away.`'
Again he said, '`I have seen great things since my sickness;
things which I think not lawful to be spoken.`'
Much good counsel and advice dropped from him, at sundry times,
that was not taken down in writing,
which he gave at times to his friends and relations about him,
and often said to his wife, '`My dear, grieve not, you must not grieve;
I want to be where the weary are at rest, and where the wicked cease from troubling.
I want to be dissolved, that I may be with the Lord Jesus Christ.
The Lord will provide for you and your children: he has said,
"`Let the widows trust in me, and I will take care of their fatherless children.`"`'

When he was asked if he desired to see his youngest child, he being some miles distant,
he answered, '`He is young, and has little knowledge of me.
I commit him to the great God: he will take care of him.`'
He spoke this with more than ordinary sedateness, adding, '`I am not afraid of death.
I have sought the honor of God in my day, and my reward is with him.
The Lord has been very good to me in this sickness.
I can say with the Psalmist, he has made my bed in my sickness.
I have many sweet seasons from the Lord in the night when I cannot sleep.
Oh!
I enjoy sweet peace from him.
Oh! the love of the Lord Jesus Christ is great to mankind.`'

'`The Lord visited me in my tender years, and I have feared him from my childhood.
I have delighted to wipe the shoes of those that preach the gospel, when I was a boy.
Since I have been a man, I have taken more delight in serving the Lord,
his church and people, than in getting worldly riches.
I love the poor, and have loved to serve them, and to visit them in their afflictions.
Remember my love to the poor in the quarter where I dwell.`'

'`I love the ministry, I have a valuable esteem for the ministers,
and pray God sanctify and purge them, that they may go before the flock.
I pray God bless the young generation of ministers that are coming up,
and make them skillful in the work, that they may divide the word aright,
that like the Benjamites of old, they may shoot an arrow +++[+++or sling a stone]
to a hair`'s breadth.`'

He died the 12th of the Seventh month, 1706, aged about forty-three years;
and was decently buried from the meetinghouse near Devonshire-square,
accompanied by a great number of friends to Bunhill burying-ground,
and many living testimonies were borne to the truth, in which he lived and died.

He collected and wrote the several books following:
The Harmony of the Old and New Testament; a Concordance; A Trumpet Sounded;
The Great Duty of Prayer; Piety Promoted, first, second, and third parts;
which are proofs of his zeal for truth, his love to all people,
and that he was well acquainted with the Holy Scriptures.

ROBERT HUBERSTIE, late of Yelland-Compers, in the county of Lancaster,
was visited with the day-spring from on high,
and brought to the knowledge of God`'s eternal truth,
as professed by the people called Quakers, about the year 1653, which he received, loved,
and obeyed.
He was often a great sufferer by imprisonment for his faithful testimony to the truth,
and by spoiling of his goods for peaceably meeting to worship Almighty God,
in the spirit of his Son, according as he requires,
and bearing his testimony faithfully against that
cruel and anti-christian oppression of tithes.
After his release out of prison, he travelled in the work of the ministry,
the Lord having bestowed a good gift upon him,
and committed to him the word of reconciliation.
He travelled in the power of it for the good of souls,
and visited the churches of Christ, through most parts of this nation,
exhorting and advising friends in the love of God,
to feel the life-giving presence and power of the Lord in all their meetings,
that therein they might be refreshed and strengthened to wait upon God,
and to worship him in his eternal spirit and truth.

Being returned, he was taken sick,
and in the time thereof he had many comfortable expressions, saying,
'`I have peace with God, through Jesus Christ,
and am content in his heavenly will to live or die,
having sought God`'s glory before my own interest in this world.`'
He often advised those present to be faithful to what God had manifested to them,
and to bear a faithful testimony to the truth.
After a sore fit of pain, he said,
'`It is good to have the Lord near at such a pinching time as this,
and to have nothing to do but to die.`'
A few days before he died, he called his son and the rest of his family,
and said he must take his leave of them;
and desired them to live in love and peace one with another,
and to love the truth above all,
and to bear a faithful testimony for God and his truth while on earth,
and the Lord would bless them.
He desired that his love might be remembered to faithful friends,
some of whom he mentioned by name.

He bore his sickness and pain with much patience, and uttered many sweet expressions,
which were not taken.
He was preserved sensible to the last,
having been a believer in the truth about fifty-three years,
and a prisoner near five years; aged about seventy-one years.

He died the 12th, and was buried the 14th of the Eighth month, 1706.

=== Here follows a Testimony of an ancient friend and acquaintance of R. Huberstie`'s.

Since I have had the opportunity of reading the above-written lines,
relating to my dear deceased friend and brother in the nearest
and dearest relation of God`'s blessed truth,
who was convinced thereof in the next year after I was, when we were both young in years;
and remembering the glory of that day of visitation of our souls,
and the comfortable fellowship of the Spirit we have since enjoyed together;
and also Providence so ordering, that my lot fell to see him in his bodily weakness,
and to be comforted in the beholding that sweet contented frame of spirit he lay in,
together with the affecting words that then dropped from him,
I felt some concern upon my mind to add in short, as follows:

That he was a man truly fearing God, faithful to the manifestation of truth,
firm and noble in his testimony and sufferings therefor.
+++[+++He was]
of latter years, an able, zealous, and laborious minister of Christ Jesus,
concerned for good order in the church; serving the Lord faithfully in his day,
and died the death of the righteous.
His latter end was like theirs, namely, full of joy in righteousness,
and assurance of eternal life and glory, as he intimated to me in a divine sense thereof,
a very few days before his departure, saying that he was well in mind,
freely given up to the will of God, and possessed perfect peace,
patiently waiting for his being delivered out of
that pain and trouble of body in God`'s time,
desiring to be remembered to all faithful friends, and desiring me, and one other friend,
to be at his burial.
And the Lord by providence made way, that I therein answered his desire,
it being the day aforesaid, in Friends`' burying-place at Yeland,
where a great appearance of Friends was,
and a great many of the chief and sober neighbors, yes, several that were not invited;
which did demonstrate the good respect he had among all sorts of people.
The Lord was pleased upon that solemn occasion, to bless us with his glorious presence,
and to open the mouths of several of his servants in a living testimony to his truth;
and also to magnify his holy and powerful name for his marvelous salvation,
revealed in and through the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior, to whom, with the Father,
belong dominion, glory, and eternal praise, world without end, Amen.

JOHN CARLILE, of the city of Carlisle, in the county of Cumberland,
was born at Blackwell, three miles from the city of Carlisle, and was by trade a tanner.
Through the gracious visitation of God,
he was convinced of the blessed truth about the year 1673,
by the ministry of John Graves,
being much reached and confirmed by virtue of the power of truth.
He grew and increased in faithfulness, according to his measure;
and was drawn forth sometimes in a public testimony, and preached the gospel,
not in the eloquence of speech, but very powerful and reaching,
and in simplicity and sincerity.
Although illiterate as to outward learning,
yet in his doctrine and testimony he considerably opened the scriptures of truth,
by the assistance of that holy Spirit that gave them forth,
to the edification of the hearers,
and confirmation of those gospel truths by him preached.
He labored in the work of the ministry in several counties, as Cumberland, Westmoreland,
Bishopric, and part of Lancashire; also in Northumberland, and in Scotland.
Several were convinced by his labors of love in the gospel of Christ in many places,
and remain as seals of his ministry.

He was open-hearted, and zealous for the testimony of truth,
and in much love received the friends of it, who travelled in the same work,
into his house.
As he delighted to draw near to the well-spring of life,
for divine succor and consolation,
he was not unmindful often to wait upon the Lord in his family,
to whom the Lord was pleased to reach, in order to their convincement,
by his blessed truth.
He was sometimes opened to speak a few words to them of information or exhortation;
and sometimes to supplicate the Lord; and other times in silence,
to wait upon the Lord in his family,
to feel an increase and growth in the virtue of truth among them.
Many are witnesses of the benefit and comfort they received in those his family meetings,
that have been at them.
Although at his first convincement in the city,
and when he came to bear testimony to the truth,
he was as a speckled bird among the birds of the wood,
there being none who bore the same profession in the said city,
and was warred against by the bitter magistrates, and severe informers,
and cruel persecutors; yet such was the Lord`'s goodness to him,
that he was preserved faithful in his testimony for the Lord through all.
Some of his persecutors fell into great distress, and died miserably;
and others of them fell into great poverty; so that a prison became their dwelling,
and therein they died.

He was always ready to help forward and encourage every good work on truth`'s account,
and was much given to hospitality, and was open-hearted to the poor of any society.
He was of blameless conduct, just in his dealings, and of a good report among all people,
and valiant for truth and its testimony to the end.
In his sickness he often exhorted Friends to be faithful to the Lord and his truth,
according to their measure; saying, then the Lord would stand by them,
and bring them through all the exercises they might meet with for the same,
and they should have the reward of well done; with more expressions of the like nature.

Having some sight of the glory and joys of heaven,
that those who are faithful and upright-hearted shall enjoy,
and that evidence in himself, of his soul`'s everlasting peace,
he signified his desire of a change,
and that his wife and children might give him freely up, saying it would be well.
Being sensible the time of his departure drew near,
he said to his friends and neighbors present,
that a little time would finish and make all things easy.
In about half an hour he passed away, being the 25th of the Twelfth month, 1706;
and died in the faith of Jesus, and in full unity with Friends,
having borne an innocent testimony for truth in his generation,
and left a good savor behind him.
Aged about seventy-four years.

JOHN ELLIS was one on whom the Lord bestowed a gift in the ministry,
who labored in the gospel of the grace of God for the good of souls,
and freely preached it in the authority of divine life,
to the reaching God`'s witness in many hearts.

He was zealous for God, and tender of the good in all;
but terrible against the workers of iniquity.
Grave and reverend in the exercise of his gift,
his testimony full of reproof and caution;
but in that meekness which made the same to be edifying.
His doctrine sound,
flowing from the living fountain and divine spring of life and heavenly wisdom.

He was a man of great kindness, loving, meek, and humble;
a visitor of the widows and fatherless in their distress, he sympathized with them;
fed the hungry, clothed the naked, according to his ability,
and labored greatly in Dorsetshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Devonshire,
and other places; often saying, his Father`'s business must not be neglected,
or done negligently.
As he was traveling in the service of truth,
he was taken sick ten miles from his habitation.
He exhorted that every one should keep close to the truth,
that the Lord had made known to them, and said on his deathbed to his wife,
'`It is hid from me,`' speaking of his death, '`but if this is my time, I am ready.
There is nothing to be laid to my charge;
there is a fountain of life that we must all come to, that runs sweetly.`'
His daughter standing by, he gave her a charge,
that she should not mix with any in the world, and that she should not be troubled;
'`for,`' said he, '`I have a sure foundation.`'
He uttered many other sweet expressions, that could not be distinctly understood;
but concluded, saying, '`I salute you all;`' and departed the 31st of the First month,
1707, and was decently interred in Friends`' burying-ground at Poole,
the 4th of the Second month following,
and several testimonies were borne to the truth on that occasion.

MARY STOUT, relict of Henry Stout, of Hartford, was an honest, ancient Friend,
that was early convinced of the blessed truth, and retained her love to it,
and the friends of it, unto death.
Being weak and near her end, she said on her deathbed, the 31st of the First month, 1707,
'`I have nothing to do but to die, if it should be this night.
I have received the earnest of that inheritance that shall never fade away.`'
R+++.+++ T. next day coming to see her, asked her how she did.
She said, '`I am very weak, but very well satisfied to die, if my time be come;
for the Lord is with me, and that is a precious jewel.`'
R+++.+++ T. said, '`So it is, which the world cannot give;`' she said, '`No, nor take away.`'
R+++.+++ T. asking her if she had settled her affairs,
she replied she had nothing to do but to die.

The 6th of the Second month, several Friends being come to visit her, she said,
'`I take your visit very kindly, that I might see you before I die.
I never was thus weak before in my life, yet I have nothing laid to my charge.
The Lord has been with me in my exercise.`'
Then said to G. W., '`And you have been a dear friend to me.`'

On the 7th of the Second month, about the eighth hour in the morning, G. W. went to her,
she then appearing near death, saying to her, '`The Lord make your passage easy,
and give you rest.`'
And near the ninth hour the same morning, she quietly departed without sigh or groan.
Aged about eighty years, and had for some years, at certain times,
used to speak a few weighty and seasonable words in Friends`' meetings.

FRANCES RUTT, of Hartford, was an ancient, true, and serviceable woman,
to whom the Lord had given a public testimony to bear for the truth,
which she had known and professed for many years, and lived therein,
who was exemplary in her conduct, and a lover of her friends and all people.
When near her end, and Friends stood about her, she said to them,
'`You must not depend upon words, but upon the pure spring of life in your own hearts,
and upon the word of the Lord that endures forever.`'

Thus this faithful woman, who had preached the word,
counseled Friends to depend upon it as that which
is able to quicken and reconcile to God,
sanctify and save the souls of all that are obedient thereto unto death,
as no doubt she experienced it.

She departed this life the 7th of the Third month, 1707.

JOHN SAGER, of Marsden, in the county of Lancaster, was born the 3rd of the Eighth month,
1627, and convinced of the truth about the beginning of the year 1653,
at a meeting at Brighouse, in Yorkshire, by our dear and ancient friend, George Fox,
of whom he always after retained an honorable esteem.

The said John Sager was constant and zealous in bearing a faithful testimony for truth,
and against tithes,
often exhorting Friends to faithfulness in their testimony against the same.
He often suffered the spoiling of his goods, even in those early days;
the first of which was in the year 1655.
He also suffered imprisonment five times, and often under close confinement,
by reason whereof his tender wife and family went through great hardships.
When with his family, he was a constant attender of week-day meetings,
and meetings for discipline, and very zealously concerned for the promotion thereof,
being a man given up to do and suffer for the truth, of which he had received a measure,
or talent, to improve, and was thereby enabled to bear all his great sufferings,
and other trials, with much patience;
often saying he was made willing by the power of God to give up
his life as a farther seal to the testimony he had borne,
if the Lord did require it.
He often blessed the Lord,
that he had accounted him worthy to suffer for his name`'s sake;
desiring the Lord might forgive his adversaries what they had done against him.

In his latter days, the nearer he drew to his change, which he long waited for,
he was the more raised up in living testimony in meetings,
in exhortation to diligence and faithfulness in the gift received,
and in praising the Lord for his mercies bestowed upon him and his people.
In his last sickness, under the great weakness and distempers,
which then attended his aged body, he was always cheerful and contented,
praising the Lord for his merciful dealings with him.
He was visited by many, both friends and others, and was often raised beyond expectation,
to declare the truth, exhorting all to mind the light of Christ Jesus,
wherewith they were enlightened; often saying all was well with him,
he had nothing to do but to die.

The night before his departure, several Friends coming to visit him, he said,
'`I believe the time of my departure is at hand, and I enjoy great peace and comfort,
and desire the Lord may preserve you, when you come to lie in the condition I do,
and that you may enjoy the same comfort I do now enjoy;`' continuing in fervent prayer.
Next morning, being very sensible to the last, he departed in great peace and quietness,
being the 24th of the Fifth month, 1707.
Aged seventy-nine years and nine months; a minister of Christ.

In the year 1660 he was imprisoned for not swearing,
and remained a prisoner in Lancaster six weeks.
In the year 1668 he was imprisoned again for not swearing,
and was a prisoner at Preston seven weeks.
In the year 1669 he was imprisoned for nonpayment
of tithes at Lancaster four years and six weeks.
In the year 1687 he was a prisoner on the same account at Lancaster one year.
In the year 1691 he was a prisoner again, about tithes at Lancaster,
four years and two months.
So that in all he was a prisoner nearly ten years.

SAMUEL HUNT, of Nottingham, a minister of Christ, and a faithful servant in his church,
who labored and travelled for the good of souls,
was taken ill at London about the Eighth month, 1707, at the house of Thomas Huttson,
in George-yard, in Lombard-street.
Being apprehensive of his death, he said,
'`I have labored faithfully in the service of the Lord.
I am not afraid to die, for all will be well with me.`'
Soon after he took his bed, he said, '`Dear Lord, you know I love you and your truth,
and have never thought much to spend and be spent for you,
and if my time be come to leave this troublesome world, I am willing.`'

He said to Thomas Huttson and his wife,
'`Our first acquaintance together was in the love of God,
and in that let us live and abide, and in that shall we part one from another.`'

About twelve hours before his departure, several friends were visiting him,
and although he was very weak in body, and his distemper very sharp and strong upon him,
yet he was raised in spirit, and filled with the love of Christ,
insomuch that he uttered many sweet expressions, and precious sayings,
and such a stream of love and life attended him,
that the hearts of all friends there present were melted.
He was heard to say something of the man-made ministers,
but spoke so low it could not be farther understood,
until he was somewhat more strengthened, and his voice raised, then he spoke audibly,
and said, '`Away with this chaffy nature,
it is fit for nothing but to be driven before the wind.
The sound of the instrument is but empty,
except the matter proceed from the pure spring of immortal life.`'
Then being silent, and retired in mind for some time, he broke forth, saying,
'`O sweet composure of mind!
Who is here?
Who is here?
The beloved of my soul, the chiefest of ten thousands!
Dear Lord, I will not let you go!
O your love is sweet and precious!
O that we may live in you, and dwell in you,
you pure ocean and divine fountain of eternal sweetness!
Who can withhold praising you, you living God! oh! we will bless your name.
Praises, honor, and glory, be given to you, through Jesus Christ,
forever and forevermore.`'

When friends were taking leave of him, he said, '`Dear friends, farewell; all is well,
all is well.
If we love one another, and love the Lord, and love his truth, all will be well.`'
When he had taken leave of his wife, and several in the family, and M. H. coming in,
and his wife acquainting him thereof, he said, being sensible to the last, '`Farewell,
dear Mary, farewell in Christ; we have lived in love,
and in love we part;`' these were his last words.
He departed not long after, being the 3rd of the Ninth month, 1707, aged forty-one years.

But before his departure, he dictated the following letter to his son.

Son Samuel,

First learn to live in the love and fear of God,
and if you meet with any disappointment,
you may apply yourself to him the more freely for assistance,
it being your father`'s daily practice, in what exercises he has met with in this world.
Be truly honest, both towards God and man;
always laboring in your mind to contradict any thing that may be otherwise.
I recommend this practice: privately to go into your chamber twice a day,
to wait upon the Lord for counsel and instruction in all things.

And it is your father`'s desire, that you may be loving and dutiful unto your mother,
and loving and kind to your wife.

NICHOLAS GATES, late of Alton, in Hampshire, clothier, son of William Gates,
of the same place, was,
from the time he understood there was a God who made the world and all things therein,
desirous to have the true knowledge of him.
In his childhood he took great delight in reading the Holy Scriptures,
and in hearing the best reformed ministers,
and gave himself often to private praying to the Lord unknown, uttering words before him,
until on a time in his chamber kneeling down by his bedside, in order to utter words,
he was stopped, and it was said to him in his heart, as he declared and believed,
by the Lord, '`You need not utter words, for I know your heart and soul`'s desire.`'
So remaining kneeling a while, he arose, but uttered no words.

About the age of twenty-one years,
he came to join with those people in scorn called Quakers,
and was rejected by his father, and became an alien to his father`'s house,
and many times threatened to be cast off, yet he loved his father dearly.
The Lord was more to him than his father, and fitted him for his service,
and gave him a gift of the ministry,
and called him forth freely to preach the gospel of the grace of God,
and made him an experimental witness of the sufficiency thereof.
He labored earnestly therein in several parts of England,
to invite all to receive and come under its teachings.
By the power and grace of God, he was supported under, and carried through,
all the trials and exercises, stonings, stockings, reproachings, imprisonments,
and spoiling of goods he met with for the truth`'s sake, and his testimony thereto.

He was religiously exemplary in his family, and among all where he travelled,
preached sound doctrine, lived a holy life, was just in his dealing,
diligent in his calling, a tender husband, a loving father, a kind friend,
a good neighbor, a follower of peace, delighted in hospitality, sought unity,
and labored to preserve it in the bonds of peace.
He was diligent in attending meetings, both First-days and other days,
and in the service of quarterly and monthly meetings, and in taking care of the poor,
and was greatly blessed of God.
This servant of Christ being taken ill the 10th of the Tenth month, 1707,
the first thing he expressed his care for, was the church,
and to have friends preserved in unity,
saying he was well satisfied with the Lord`'s dealing with him.
He has been a good God to me all along, and has let me live to good old age,
and been my support from time to time, and is so in this present exercise.`'
Another time he said, '`My days are expiring quickly;
but I have lived to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.`'

He then expressed his love to his wife in a very tender, affectionate manner,
and prayed to the Lord that he would bless and preserve her and his children to the end,
desiring they might live together in love, and watch over one another therein.
He said he did not know, if he had his time to live over again, that he could die better,
having the evidence in himself of well done; yet he said,
if the Lord did see fit to restore him,
and he could be an instrument to gain more souls to God, he could be glad;
for that was his great joy,
when he considered how he had spent his time in the Lord`'s service.
This honest, zealous old man gave good advice to many that came to see him,
and for their children, laying a charge upon such friends as had them,
to keep their children to the plain language,
and to bring them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord;
and admonishing his own children to do so by their children,
and to ask them questions for opening their understanding,
that they might know what God is, and where he is to be found,
and to do thus while they are young and tender; and said, '`Oh! that men,
especially young men, did know the comfort of living a sober life.`'

A neighbor coming to visit him, asked him how he did; he replied, '`Weak,
and am going soon out of this troublesome world,
to a place where there is neither sorrow nor trouble.`'
After this, he said, '`Friends were formerly known by their fewness of words,
and keeping to their word in their dealings.`'
He very often desired Friends to keep to plainness, both in habit and speech,
warning his daughter Deborah present, and his wife, to watch over her children,
to keep them out of pride, saying, '`There is scarcely a worse weed than pride.`'
A while before he died, he said,
'`The door of entrance is open into the kingdom;`'
into which it is not doubted but he is entered.
He departed the 21st of the Tenth month, 1707, aged about seventy-four,
convinced about fifty-two years; and was honorably buried on the 24th,
in Friends`' burying-ground at Alton,
after a very solemn meeting of many Friends and others,
and left his wife twenty-one children and grandchildren.

MARY MOORE, late wife of John Moore, of Eldworth, in the county of York,
daughter of Thomas Camm, was seized with sickness,
which continued upon her about three months, which she bore with much patience,
often saying she was well content with the will of God.
Her dear father being then from home in the service of truth,
her husband several times asked her if he might not write to her father,
to acquaint him with her weakness, and to desire his return home.
She answered she should be right glad to see him,
but she would not have his service hindered upon her account,
hoping when that was over he might return in due time to see her.
Accordingly, upon the 30th of the Sixth month, 1707, he got to Eldworth,
and found his daughter very weak;
but the surprise of joy to see him had liked to overwhelm her spirits,
so that for a time she could not speak to him.
In a little time she got over it,
and expressed her great joy and satisfaction to see him, saying,
'`Now the Lord has answered my desire; and now I leave all to his wise disposing,
whether life or death.`'
She continued pretty easy, still, and resigned; and about a week after she grew worse;
but said to her father, '`I am resigned to the will of God, and gathered out of care,
touching visible things; only some fear is upon my mind touching my eldest son,
that it will prove to his harm to be schooled where he now is, therefore,
I desire he may be removed to some good place and school.`'
This was promised her should be done as speedily as well could be;
at which she seemed contented and easy.
She often signified her resignedness to the will of God,
praying be endued with patience to the end of her race:
and the Lord was pleased to hear and answer.
She bore all her long exercise with great patience.
On the 12th of the Seventh month, though much weakened,
she was opened and strengthened to speak very strongly,
which was written down as follows:

'`Oh! what a blessing have I enjoyed in this my quarter of a year`'s weakness.
It has been the best and most sweet, pleasant, and profitable time of all my life.
I have seen the end of all worldly enjoyments.
Although I have a kind father, a loving husband, and dear babes, yet I can freely, yes,
heartily, with all my heart, leave all to be with Christ my Redeemer, my Savior,
and the beloved of my soul.
Oh! he has been near me, yes, with me day and night.
He has so drawn me, and won upon me, with the cords of his love, taking me by the hand,
and opening his arms to receive me into his bosom, that I am overcome with his love.
Very gentle has his hand been upon me;
and he has blessed me with great contentment and patience.
I am freely resigned up to the will of my God.
As for my poor babes, I commit them to the Lord who gave me them.
They have also two good fathers, who will take care of them,
where I can leave them freely; only I desire you, father,
to take care of John`'s schooling and education,
and get him apprentice to some good Friend at Bristol, or elsewhere, as you see fit.
All my care I have cast upon God, and upon you, my father and my husband;
so that I am easy.
Blessed be the Lord for this good and precious time,
wherein I am freely devoted to his will, and right glad to leave this troublesome world,
having the earnest of that eternal glorious redemption,
through my blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.`'

Then calling her children one by one, charged them, saying, '`Fear God,
dwell in love one with another,
and be sure obey your father;`' then blessing them particularly in the name of the Lord,
and committing them all unto him.
When she parted with her youngest babe, she kissed her, and said, '`They tell me that you,
poor lamb, will have the greatest loss of me;
yet as I have cast all my care for you upon the Lord, I am easy,
and leave you to his protection and divine providence, who gave you all to me,
who never fails those that trust in him, being a tender Father,
both to the fatherless and motherless children.`'

To her eldest son John she farther added, '`I have been a tender mother to you,
and now must leave you.
Therefore, dear child, observe the counsel and advice of your dying mother,
write them down, and imprint them in your mind.
First, I charge you to fear and remember God your Creator in the days of your youth.
Refrain all evil company; be sober and attentive to all good counsel;
let not your mind go roving after foolish toys,
and do nothing but what is good and commendable;
and then you will not need to make any excuse or lie;
for a lying tongue is an abomination to the Lord.
Read, and remember what wise Solomon says will be the portion of such
as despise or neglect the good counsel of father or mother,
and thereby do evil in breaking God`'s command, to obey father and mother.
Oh! dear child, consider of these things, and be wise: God Almighty bless you,
and you all, and preserve you out of all evil.
This is the one great thing that I desire for you; not to be great in the world,
which hurts many; but to be great in virtue and godliness,
which has the promise both of this world, and that which is to come.`'

Then she lay still some little time, desiring all might leave the room except Anna,
her husband`'s eldest daughter,
between whom and her there had been a great endearedness and strong bond of love.
After some time her father, Thomas Camm, coming into the room again,
and hearing her and her daughter Anna in discourse, sat down out of her sight,
and heard her say to Anna, that she left her as a mother to her motherless children;
bidding her call to mind how she and her two younger sisters, by Providence,
fell under her care when very young,
and how she had faithfully discharged her trust in tender care over them;
and she desired no better for hers than she had done for them,
when they could not do for themselves.
Anna then tenderly telling her mother,
she hoped that forever her children should lack nothing
that was in her power to do for them,
she being sensible of the strong obligation of duty she was under,
and so they left things.
After some time, she said, '`What a comfort and joy it is,
to be so near the end of this troublesome world.`'

She was always very glad of friends`' company in visits and little meetings,
which at several times were kept in her chamber, which, she said,
were to her great refreshment; the last was the evening before she died; after which,
she said, '`This is likely to be the last.`'
Next morning she said, '`This night, and a little part of next day will finish here.`'
That night she had very sharp pangs, hard for her father and others to hear;
so that he left the room once or twice, but could not stay easily in or out;
and an exercise or concern came upon his spirit, to pray to the Lord for her;
and the Lord was pleased to hear the supplication that was put up;
so that she had no more such sharp pangs,
and finished her course here on the 15th of the Seventh month, 1707:
and it is not doubted but she is at rest with the Lord.

She was decently interred in her husband`'s burying-place at Eldworth,
on the 17th of the same month, being her birthday, and also her marriage day, and,
had she lived to that day, her age would have been thirty-eight years.

The loss of her was greatly lamented, not only by her relations and nearest friends,
but neighbors, both poor and rich, her loving, innocent,
and wise conduct and deportment having gained her great
respect among persons of all sorts that knew her.
Oh! that many in observing and following her pious example,
may be stirred up more and more to seek after virtue and godliness,
and thereby purchase to themselves a good name, as she has done,
through love and obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ,
is the chief design in publishing these lines.

THOMAS CAMM, late of Camsgill, in the county of Westmoreland, was born in the year 1641,
of honest, religious, and godly parents, was well educated,
and from his childhood inclined to be religious, and sought after the best things.
He delighted in the company of the best, or most religious sort of people;
and in his tender years the Lord was pleased to visit
him with the light of the day springing from on high,
and thereby convinced him of his blessed and unchangeable truth;
even in the morning of the day, to these latter ages of the world;
and after some time called him forth into the work of the ministry,
for which the Lord fitted him.
Being thus visited and called of God,
he counted nothing too near or dear to part with for truth`'s sake;
but left all to follow the Lord,
and with his whole strength and substance was given up to serve him,
and faithfully to do the work he was called to.
The Lord who had called him to such a great and glorious work,
as preaching the everlasting gospel, did fitly qualify him for the same,
pouring forth upon him of his holy spirit, and endued him with divine wisdom,
whereby he was made an able preacher of the word of life to many,
and could divide it aright, according to the states of the people.

As he was thus called and qualified,
so he was diligent and laborious in the work of the Lord in many parts of this nation,
and was made instrumental to convince and establish many in the way of truth.
His doctrine was sound, and his delivery powerful;
and though his testimony was not with the enticing words of men`'s wisdom,
yet it was in the demonstration of that divine power,
which reached the witness of God in the hearts of the hearers.

Great and many were the sufferings he met with,
and he very patiently bore and went through them, of many sorts and kinds,
as imprisonments, spoiling of goods, mockings and scoffings from those without,
and suffering among false brethren.
In all which he stood firm and faithful in his testimony for truth,
approving himself a true follower of Jesus Christ,
suffering joyfully for his name`'s sake, who had counted him worthy, not only to believe,
but to suffer for him.
As he was a man wonderfully endued with heavenly and divine wisdom,
so he was a man of great humility,
very much laboring for love and unity among brethren,
and where any thing appeared tending to a breach of it,
he always used his utmost endeavors to put a stop thereto,
approving himself to be a man of peace, and always labored for it,
both in the church and also among all sorts of people.

He was a man beloved of God, and by all good men who knew him.
He was a nursing father to many,
encouraging everything that was good in the least child;
but very zealous against every appearance of evil;
especially against that which in any wise tended to the laying
waste of that testimony which the Lord required his people to bear,
being zealously concerned to keep his testimony clear in every branch of it.
He was a man well qualified for discipline, and labored very much to promote it,
for the encouragement of those who were weak,
and to bring to judgment those that were loose, and would let their testimony fall.
He was very zealous against that anti-christian yoke of tithes,
and though he suffered very much on that account, yet he stood faithful to the last,
and rejoiced in his sufferings upon that and all other accounts for truth`'s sake.

Though in the latter part of his time he was attended with much bodily weakness,
which through his many hard labors, travels, and sufferings, was come upon him,
yet such was his zeal for truth, and love for the friends of it,
that he was willing to spend his time and strength for and in the service of truth,
which he faithfully performed, to the comfort and edification of the churches of Christ.

On the 17th of the Eleventh month, 1707,
having been in the love of God to visit several meetings in the upper end of Lancashire,
Westmoreland, and the west of Yorkshire, he returned to his son John Moore`'s,
at Eldworth, and that very day it pleased the Lord,
by a gentle hand (as he phrased it) to bring his old distemper upon him.
After some few days it grew more violent and hard upon him;
he bore it with much patience,
and continued in a weakly distempered state of body for five or six weeks,
taking very little natural food, nor getting much sleep or rest at nights;
yet could walk up and down his chamber, and was always pretty cheerful,
and freely resigned to the will of God, often saying,
'`I neither desire to live nor to die, but am well content,
however it shall please the Lord to order it;`' farther saying, '`If the Lord sees fit,
or has yet any farther service for me to do, it is easy with him to raise me up again;
but his will be done, I am very well content, I bless the Lord.`'

Near the conclusion of his days, he said, '`I have great peace and satisfaction,
in that I have done the will of God.
I do not know that I have much more to do, the time of my departure seems to draw nigh;
but I am well satisfied.
I bless the Lord, I can say with the Apostle, "`I have fought a good fight;
I have finished my course; I have kept the faith,
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only,
but to them also that love his appearing.`"

One day, he being alone in his chamber, his son John Moore came and sat down by him,
and asked him how he did; he answered, '`I am but weakly of body,
but strong in the inner man, blessed be the Lord,
who has been my support and strength hitherto.`'
He then farther said, '`I have been pondering in my mind,
and meditating of the wonderful and unspeakable mercies and loving-kindnesses of God,
to me extended all my life long, even to this very day; that I, such a poor, weak,
feeble creature, should be enabled to hold out, and go through those many trials,
travails, sufferings and exercises, both inward and outward, of various kinds,
that have fallen to my lot.
It has indeed been the Lord`'s doing,
who is and has been all along my buckler and my shield,
he shall have the praise and the glory of all, for he alone is worthy of it,
forever and forevermore.`'

His distemper continuing, and his bodily strength growing weaker,
so that there was little likelihood of his recovery,
he gave very plain and distinct directions concerning his burial,
as one not much concerned at his approaching departure.

Being grown so weak he could not well go alone, without some little support,
one evening as he was walking over his chamber floor,
leaning upon his son J. Moore`'s arm, his legs trembled under him, which he observing,
said, '`Dear John, when the pillars of the house begin to tremble, there is feeble work.
But then, blessed are they who, when this earthly tabernacle is ready to be dissolved,
do assuredly know that they have a habitation eternal in the heavens,
whose builder and maker the Lord is; of which, for my part,
I bless the Lord I am well satisfied.`'

About a week before he died, several of John Moore`'s children being in the room with him,
he said to them, '`Now I think I must leave you.
If the Lord had seen fit to spare me a little longer,
I might have been of service to you in counsel and advice; but the Lord,
the great and wise counsellor, as you have your eye to him above all things,
will not be lacking to you in counsel.
I love you entirely, and the blessing of the Almighty rest upon you, if it be his will.`'

He several times spoke concerning Esau; one time he said,
'`Esau`'s mount was in part consumed and consuming,
yet there were branches still remained;`' and said,
'`The Lord lay it waste more and more.`'

Another time he said, '`Faith and patience, hope and charity, are excellent virtues;
the Lord, if it be his will, endue his children and people more and more therewith.`'

When he was grown so very weak that the getting his
clothes on and off was somewhat difficult and troublesome,
he one time said to those about him, '`Dear children,
you have a great deal of trouble and exercise about me, the Lord be your reward;
but you shall see a little time will put an end to all these troubles,
and a happy end it will be for me, I doubt it not at all.`'

Another time, being some days before he died,
John Moore`'s eldest daughter standing by him, he took her by the hand, and said,
'`Dear Anna, the Lord will reward you for your care and pains about me.`'
Seeing her affected with sorrow,
as well she might be for the approaching loss of so near and dear a friend,
he farther added, '`Death will not be said no; but it will be well with me,
the enemy cannot touch me.
The Lord who has been with me,
and has borne up my spirit through and over all the
various exercises and trials of my time;
he will be with me to the end; there is no doubt of it.`'

One time lying upon his bed, in a sweet and heavenly frame of mind and spirit, he said,
'`I have served the Lord in sincerity, with all my heart, and with all my soul,
and with all my strength; hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.`'
And so went on praising and magnifying the Lord,
to the melting and tendering the hearts of all present.
Afterwards he said to John Moore, and some others who were with him, '`Bear me record,
I die in perfect unity with the brethren;
my love is as firm and true as ever in our Lord Jesus Christ,
the author of our salvation.`'

When grown very weak, being asked how he did, he would say, '`Weak of body,
but strong in the Lord;`' saying also, '`In Abraham`'s bosom there is sweet repose.`'
He several times spoke of the efficacy and virtue of the wine of the kingdom;
and about two days before he died, he seemed to be faint,
and J. Moore gave him a little wine to sup, thinking it might refresh him,
but his stomach could not bear it.
Then looking pretty cheerfully at J. Moore, he said, '`Dear John,
you see these things will not do; but one cup of new wine in the heavenly kingdom,
with my dear and blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, will make up all.`'

His strength decaying very fast, he for the most part lay very still and quiet,
as one waiting for his dissolution, not saying much, unless when spoken to,
and then would answer very sensibly to what he was asked.

On the day he died, he was desirous to be helped out of his bed,
but seeing how very weak he was, he was put off for some time; but he still urged it.
J+++.+++ Moore told him, he doubted he was so weak he could scarcely bear it without fainting;
but those with him told him, they were willing to help him the best they could.
To which he replied very cheerfully, '`That is enough: I hope the Lord,
that has been my help in many straits and difficulties, will also now help me.`'
So his clothes were got ready, and by degrees got most of them on;
but before they had quite done, he was likely to faint:
so they sat him down on the bedside, and supported him a little.
After a while he somewhat revived, and looking about him,
he saw J. Moore`'s youngest child, between two and three years old,
standing before him a little way off, and he beckoned with his hand,
that she might come to him, and with a little help he set her upon his knees,
and affectionately kissing and embracing her, he said, '`God Almighty bless you.
The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, bless you, and make you happy,
if it be his will.`'
Then after a little time they got his clothes something better on,
and set him in his chair, where he sat a pretty while; then growing weary,
he desired to lie down upon his bed, which he did, and after a little time,
he was perceived to weaken very fast.
He lay still and quiet, not saying any thing that could be heard or perceived;
but drawing his breath sometimes quicker and sometimes slower,
yet without the least disturbance, or stoppage of phlegm.
He continued so for the space of about six hours;
then stretching himself forth upon his bed, he departed this life without sigh or groan,
as one falling into a deep sleep, on the 13th day of the First month, 1708,
between the hours of eleven and twelve in the night, being aged sixty-six years,
nine months, and ten days.

Thus, having fought the good fight, and finished his course well,
he laid down his head in peace with the Lord, and is freed from all his sufferings,
sorrows, and afflictions here, and entered no doubt into the kingdom of eternal glory,
forever to live, and magnify, and praise the great God, world without end.
On the 15th of the same month, his body was removed from Eldworth in Yorkshire,
where he died, to his late dwelling-house at Camsgill, in Westmoreland,
and on the 16th of the same month was carried in
a solemn manner to Friends`' burying place at Park-end,
in Preston-Patrick, being about half a mile from Camsgill.
It was accompanied there by several hundreds of people, both of the neighborhood,
and also many friends out of several of the adjacent counties,
and was there interred in a decent, Christian manner,
there being a general appearance of sorrow in those present
for the loss of so good and serviceable a man.

The corpse being interred, all, or most that were there, drew into the meetinghouse,
and had a precious edifying season together, the powerful living presence of the Lord,
in an eminent manner, overshadowing the assembly,
to the tendering and affecting many hearts.
Several testimonies were then borne,
to the sufficiency of that universal principle of divine light and grace,
which is given to be a teacher and a leader to all mankind,
and is become the teacher and the leader of all those
who are willing to be taught and led by it.
But it is, and will be, the condemnation of all those who are disobedient to,
and rebel against it, while they continue in that state.
Also several testimonies were borne, concerning this our dear friend, deceased,
as to his faithfulness, care, and labor of love in serving God`'s heritage;
as also with respect to the many trials, travels,
and deep exercises that he had faithfully gone through in his day and time,
upon truth`'s account;
all which he was enabled to perform and go through
by the power and assistance of that divine grace,
and holy spirit of God, which he still accounted his buckler and his shield,
his bow and his battle-axe, and by and through which, he was what he was,
and to which alone, and not to him as man, the praise and glory of all was attributed.

So friends having cleared themselves of what was upon their minds, the meeting broke up,
and friends parted with hearts deeply affected,
and filled with the love and goodness of God,
which had been plentifully shed abroad among them that day; praises, honor,
and glory over all, be given unto God, and to the Lamb,
who sits with him upon the throne, who is worthy forever, and forevermore.
Amen.

RICHARD DAVIES, of Cloddiecochion, in Montgomeryshire, by trade a felt-maker,
was convinced of the blessed truth about the year 1657,
and became faithful unto the Lord, through the power of it,
and thereby was made a minister of the word of life,
and was concerned freely to preach the gospel of salvation.
He was endued with spiritual gifts,
and serviceable in the exercise thereof in the churches of Christ,
both with respect to his sound doctrine and exemplary conduct,
and diligence to serve the widow and fatherless, and was fervent in prayer.
His last sickness was but short, for he was taken ill on the sixth day of the week,
and died on the First-day of the next following.
Some Friends of Dolobran meeting came to him,
and they had a meeting with him in his bed-chamber,
and he desired them to pray to the Lord, that he might have an easy passage, saying,
'`The fervent prayer of the righteous the Lord will have a regard to.`'
But his pain continuing upon him, the next day, being the 22nd of the First month, 1708,
about the ninth hour in the morning, he departed this life, and had an easy passage,
as it were in a sleep, having often said he must sleep his long sleep.
His body, on the 25th of the same month,
was accompanied by a considerable number of Friends and other people,
to the burying-place near his own house at Cloddiecochion, and there decently interred,
and no doubt but his soul is at rest with the Lord.
Aged seventy-three; a minister about forty-five years.

SARAH GODFRY, wife of Benjamin Godfry, of Chipin, near Buntingford,
in the-county of Hartford, daughter of George and Sarah Robins, of Sandon,
in the said county, was one who loved truth in her young years,
and with a tender heart did seek the Lord often, both in and out of meetings,
and was very watchful over her words, lest she should offend the Lord,
or give an evil example to others.
She was obedient to her parents, and tender to her brethren and sisters,
and would give them good advice.
After she was married, and had children, she was concerned for them,
and desired a meeting at her house, for the good of her neighbors, which was had;
at the conclusion of which she spoke with a loud voice, and said,
'`Ever blessed and praised be the name of the Lord for this
blessed opportunity;`' which much affected the people,
knowing her great weakness.

She also expressed her willingness to die, and leave husband and children,
to go to the Lord; and then she said, '`Blessed, praised, honored, renowned, magnified,
and glorified be your name, for you are worthy of all blessing, praise, glory, and honor,
for you are a merciful God.`'
After this manner she lay praising the Lord for some time.
A neighbor coming in, who was not called a Quaker, seeing her in such a heavenly frame,
spoke with tears, '`She will not leave her fellow behind her:
she will reap the fruit of her doings, joy unspeakable, and full of glory.
"`What a mercy,`' adds the neighbor, '`it is,
the Lord lays no more upon her than he gives her patience to bear.`'
She answered, '`The Lord is very good to me, what a great mercy it is,
that I am so willing to die; what a comfort it is, over what it would be,
if I was in great distress.
I feel no condemnation.`'
She desired her mother to hold her hands as she sat in her chair, '`for,`' said she,
'`I think I am going, and I feel great peace.`'
Her mother seeing her in such a still, comfortable condition, sat a while very still,
and after she said, '`Lord, Lord, receive my soul,`' and so departed like a lamb,
in about a quarter of an hour.

JOHN PETERS, of the parish of Minver, in the county of Cornwall,
about the 26th year of his age, received the knowledge of the blessed truth,
and joined in profession with the people called Quakers.
Being zealous and faithful to the Lord, he bestowed upon him a gift,
and called him into the ministry of the word of life,
in which he was diligently exercised for many years,
and labored in the work of the gospel of Christ freely
and faithfully to the end of his days.
He was a good example in his life and conduct, and careful so to walk,
that the ministry might not be blamed in any thing by him,
being endued with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
He travelled much, not only in the county where he lived,
but frequently in the south and western counties of England, and some parts of Wales;
and as he was well known, he was well received by the faithful.

When he thought he was near expiring, he got himself raised in his bed, and said,
'`It is the Lord`'s great mercy,
who in the midst of the pains and anguish that attend our bodies,
gives us resignation of mind to his divine will.
This may be soon spoken of; but it is sweet to come to the living experience of it,
and God has mercifully given me this resignation and quietness of mind,
in which I have peace, notwithstanding the weakness and pains I lie under.`'

Then observing some young people about his bed,
he counseled them to keep low in the fear of the Lord,
not to seek to themselves great things, nor to post after the riches of this world;
though a moderate care, within the bounds of truth, was allowable.
But he spoke against extending our desires that way,
to the forgetting the work of religion, and the preparation for our latter end; '`For,`'
said he, '`a little, with God`'s blessing, will suffice.`'
He sweetly enlarged on the benefit of his blessing,
and the difference between those who enjoyed it and those who were cursed, adding,
'`In my young years I had a belief raised in me, that if I lived in the fear of God,
neither I nor mine should ever lack: and it has been all along confirmed to me.`'
He said farther, '`My heart is full of the love of God,
and the sting of death is taken away.
It would indeed be sad, at such a season of languishing,
to have a load of sin on the soul.`'

Many other seasonable counsels he then gave, that are not noted.
Another day he said to Friends present,
'`We have cause to be thankful to God for making known to us his truth.
I am evidently satisfied that the way the Lord has brought us into, is the way of truth.`'
He spoke of the necessity of living in obedience to it,
that it might be a cross to our wills and bridle to our tongues, and a stay to our minds.
He also said, '`Wait for wisdom and direction from the Lord,
to enable for such services as he requires;`' saying that the strength
of man`'s parts was not sufficient to do the Lord`'s work.
He counseled that love might be the principal motive in all public concerns,
and therein to rebuke, to exhort, and to counsel; and if, in those labors,
we meet with cross and peevish spirited people, that care might be,
not to permit the same spirit to sway us; but to overcome the evil with good, saying,
'`I have nothing in appearance but death before me; but am well satisfied,
however the Lord deals with me; for,`' said he, '`I am sound in mind,
through the Lord`'s mercy, and have abundance of ease.
I am not afraid to die.
The sting of death is taken away;`' for which he praised the Lord.
Some of his relations being desirous he should try another doctor, he said, '`Be quiet,
be still; if the Lord sees fit to lengthen my days, he can soon heal my malady;
if otherwise, I am content; for,`' adds he, '`it is no small comfort to me,
that I did not hearken to the persuasions of some
that would have me go from one doctor to another;
my confidence is in him who is alone the physician of value.
If the Lord has any further work or service for me to do, he can heal me; if not,
I have done with this world.`'

When near his end, he said to his wife, as he had often before,
'`Mourn not for me when I am gone.
I am waiting for my change, desiring to be dissolved; death is not fearful,
the sting is taken away.`'
He often cried to the Lord for a blessing on his son,
whom God had left him of ten children, and said, '`I desired,
before ever God gave me a child,
they might rather be taken off in the innocency of their days, than live to dishonor him.`'
So, in the fear and favor of God, he departed this life, the 11th of the Seventh month,
1708.

Aged about sixty-three; convinced about thirty-seven;
and a minister about twenty-five years.
He was also a prisoner several years for his testimony against tithes,
and for refusing to swear, in obedience to Christ`'s command.

His body was interred the 13th of the said Seventh month,
in Friends`' burying-ground at Minver,
being attended there by a numerous company of Friends, relations, and neighbors;
and sundry testimonies were borne to the light, life, and virtue,
wherewith God had beautified our friend, while he abode among us;
as also to the necessity of holiness and obedience,
that those who succeed him might come to die the death of the righteous,
and that their latter end might be like unto his.

GEORGE NEWLAND, son of George and Susannah Newland, of the city of Dublin, clothier,
was an orderly and dutiful child, and sought the Lord in his young and tender years.
When he was drawn or persuaded by his schoolfellows to play, or be wild,
he afterwards would be under such trouble in himself,
that he would weep and mourn in the night season.
When about ten years of age, he desired he might be sent into the country,
and retire from his companions in the city.
So in a while his parents sent him into England, and boarded him at Eleanor Haycock`'s,
widow, near Sanky, and he went to school to Gilbert Thompson, at Sanky, in Lancashire.

About the age of eleven or twelve years,
the Lord concerned him to give testimony to the truth, calling him into the ministry,
in which he was faithful, and travelled in the work thereof,
and in the exercise of that gift the Lord had bestowed upon him,
in the provinces of Leinster, Ulster, and Munster, in Ireland.
Being endued with a good understanding, he was not rash to utter words,
without the help or motion of God`'s Spirit;
so that his testimony and ministry were not only instructing but edifying;
and being an innocent youth, was beloved of faithful friends because thereof,
and his exemplary conduct,
which was according to the holy doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Between the age of eighteen and nineteen years, he was visited with lingering sickness,
and his mother asked him, after some time, whether he thought he should recover;
to which he then answered, he did not know, but if it was the Lord`'s will,
he had rather die than live; but said he dared not desire it, adding,
although his time had been short in the world,
he had gone through a great deal of exercise and trouble,
that none knew but the Lord alone.
Another time he said to his mother,
I have felt more of the Lord`'s love to me since I was sick, in a wonderful manner,
than ever before.`'
Again said, '`I strove to serve the Lord in my health, and now I reap the benefit of it.
I can look forward, and that is a mercy.`'
Being frequently comforted in spirit, and filled with the love of God, he would say,
'`Oh! if the earnest be so precious, what will the fullness be?`' When weak in body,
he was strengthened in spirit, and enlarged to praise and magnify the Lord;
and he was opened to give good counsel and advice to his brother Isaac,
taking him by the hand, kissing him, saying, '`I love you dearly;
be sure you fear and serve the Lord, and be obedient to your parents;
for though you be young and strong now, yet you know not how few your days may be.
I speak to you in love, remember my dying words when I am gone;
and that it will be enough in a dying condition, to bear the pain and affliction of body,
without having a troubled conscience;`' and therefore encouraged him to well-doing.

Much was spoken by him to his sister Elizabeth, whom he called also, and kissed her,
and tenderly desired her to love and fear the Lord, and be dutiful to her parents;
and in like manner to his sister Lydia, saying, he hoped she would be an honest woman;
and said, '`In my health, when I went to bed, I did meditate and think upon the Lord,
and now in my sickness I find the benefit thereof.`'
Then tenderly acknowledging the love and care of his parents towards him, said,
'`If I live, I can never make you amends for your trouble and care over me.`'
A few days before his death, he said unto his mother,
'`I love you dearly;`' and saluting her, said,
'`I hope the Lord will reward you for all your trouble and care over me,
and I hope we shall meet shortly, where we shall never part again.`'
Some hours before his departure, being overcome with the goodness of God,
he was enabled to praise and celebrate his name, saying with admiration, '`How good, Lord,
are you to me!
I am not worthy of the least of your mercies and favors;`'
and continued to praise the Lord in such manner,
that all that were in the room were reached and affected,
and broken by the power of`'God that attended him, during that season.

His uncle John coming to take leave of him, seeing him in this condition, yet near dying,
said he would not leave him till he saw him in his grave;
although he had intended before to go home to his dwelling that was in the country.
He was tendered to see him in such a frame of mind;
though not a frequenter of the meetings of those called Quakers,
but said he was satisfied this youth was going to his heavenly rest.
That night he was earnest with his mother to lie down and get some rest;
but after a little while called for her again, and said, '`My dear mother,
take it patiently, for you may rejoice that I am going.`'
He desired all to be quiet and still;
and sent several times to see what hour it was by the clock;
and being sensible his change was near, settled his head to the pillow,
and quietly departed this life, like an innocent lamb, on the 24th of the Eighth month,
1708, about the 2nd hour in the morning, and was buried the 26th of the same month,
in Friends`' burying place, near Dolphin`'s Barn,
being accompanied to the grave by many friends and neighbors.
Aged near nineteen, and a minister about six years.

This testimony was given by his friends in Dublin concerning him,
which I thought it right here to insert.

--

It pleased the Lord to favor this youth with a gracious visitation,
even in his childhood, and so to prepare him for his service, whereunto he appointed him,
that there appeared deep impression of a concerned mind,
for the good and eternal wellbeing of his soul.
As he grew in years, he apparently grew in grace, and in the knowledge of God,
and his son the Lord Jesus Christ;
so that the Lord was pleased to put him into the ministry.
Although young, he being sensible of the appearance of the Son of God in his heart,
did deliver his testimony with a good understanding,
not being forward or rash to utter words;
but waited for that which is the fountain of all true ministry,
i.e. The help of the Spirit of God,
that enables God`'s ministers to speak to the edifying, and instructing,
and building up of one another in the love of God.
This being the concern of this innocent youth,
made him to be beloved of faithful friends who knew him; and the more,
because his conversation agreed with his doctrine.

He went abroad sometimes to visit friends in this province of Leinster,
and was also in Ulster and Munster provinces,
and friends had generally a love and respect for him,
and there would commonly be great meetings where he was,
both friends and others admiring the Lord`'s dealings with him, in his tender years,
being but twelve years old when his mouth was first opened in meetings,
in a testimony for God.
We have a great loss of him, he being such a good example to our youth, both in that,
and also in his conduct;
too few being willing to follow him in that true nearness of walking with God, as he did;
but love liberty to the flesh and will, that works not the righteousness of God,
but brings trouble and grief on those who are concerned
for the well-being of their immortal souls;
which this youth was careful to avoid.
His behavior was more like a man of gray hairs, than one not attained to nineteen years,
being not desirous of long life in this world, as he used to express sometimes;
but rather that he might do his day`'s work, being ready and prepared,
when the Lord was pleased to call him hence, to have a portion and lot in God`'s kingdom,
of that life and peace that are everlasting.
When he was visited with the sickness of which he died,
which continued on him about a quarter of a year,
he bore it with much patience and resignation to the will of God, and very cheerfully;
which was comfortable,
both to his parents and friends who visited him in the time of his illness.

Before his departure,
he was concerned to advise and counsel his brother and sister to fear and love God,
and be dutiful to their parents, etc.
And though it is our loss, to have such a one taken from us,
we believe it is his gain to be removed from where trouble and temptations attend,
to where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.

SAMUEL WATSON, of Night Stanford, in Yorkshire, was early convinced of the blessed truth,
as professed by the people called Quakers, and being faithful to the Lord, was,
by his divine power and spirit, fitted for the ministry of the word of life,
and called by the grace of God to preach the gospel of peace,
and to labor in the service of God, for the good of souls, for many years.
The Lord was with him,
and he was kept in a sweet sense and feeling of the life and power of truth to the end;
though in his latter time he had a long season of bodily weakness.
He would very often express,
not only the goodness of God to him since the time of his first convincement,
but also was frequent in giving religious advice to those who visited him, saying,
'`Keep in the pure fear of God, it is as a fountain of life,
and from there all our comforts come.
It is that which makes people honorable, both in their youth and old age!`'

He died at Chester, and was buried there the 24th of the Ninth month, 1708.
Aged about eighty-eight years.

JOHN BOULTON, late of Gaunt`'s-Ircot, in the parish of Aldmunsbury,
in the county of Gloucester, was a faithful laborer, and true minister of the gospel,
who travelled freely to preach the same, and had eminent service therein,
as many can witness; for a divine power attended his ministry,
and many hearts were tendered, and brought into true contrition,
and to sit under his doctrine with delight, and were greatly comforted, refreshed,
and edified.
He was very serviceable in monthly and quarterly meetings,
and zealous against the anti-christian yoke of tithes,
and esteemed it an honorable testimony; and his faith was,
that none would ever prosper in the truth, who were unfaithful therein.
He was of an innocent life, and exemplary conduct, of a peaceable spirit,
and made it his concern to keep love, unity, and concord,
and frequently exhorted thereunto; and was an elder who deserved double honor,
as a nursing father in the church of Christ, and his memory is sweet and blessed.

In his last illness he often advised friends to be
faithful to what the Lord had make known to them,
while they had their health; and said, '`The Lord is good to me, it is well with me.
The Lord is wonderfully good to me.`'
Again, '`If the Lord`'s will is to take me out of this troublesome world,
I am very well content.
I am in love and peace with all men; all is well.
I shall go but a little before you.
I have made my peace with the Lord; his will be done by me, I am contented,
it is well with me.`'

These words he spoke a little before his death, and growing weak,
he desired the Lord to make his passage out of this life easy.
A Friend then taking leave of him, who was going to the quarterly-meeting, he said,
'`The salutation of my dear love, in the Lord Jesus Christ,
is to all Friends;`' and about an hour after, he said,
'`The Lord has been wonderfully kind to me,
in making my passage easy;`' and a little time after, departed in much quietness,
the 29th of the Ninth month, 1709, and was honorably buried at Hossel,
being accompanied by many Friends and neighbors.
Aged sixty-one years.

MARGARET DIAMON, wife of Richard Diamon, of London, merchant,
was daughter of captain John Groves, late of the parish of Bermondsey, in Surry, mariner,
deceased, and religiously educated by her parents in the Christian religion,
among the people called Quakers, in which she continued to her end.
In the latter part of her time she was visited with much sickness, and great pain;
yet retained her love to the Lord, his truth, and faithful people,
and her faith and hope in God, as appeared by what she declared.
She said to her husband one morning, '`Oh, my dear!
I have had a very wearisome night, and no rest; I have been in a bewildered state;
but the Lord I believe will satisfy my poor soul, it is that I now wait for.`'
After this she desired her husband to call all their children, which was done; to whom,
when come, she said, '`Be careful to keep near the Lord, and in plainness;
that it may not be said to you, "`If your mother was alive,
she would not allow you to take this liberty.`"`'

When she had given them this charge, and tender advice on her dying-bed,
worthy to be remembered, and duly observed,
she desired her husband to send to her relations, which he did.
When they came, she in much love spoke to them; and,
although the words were not noted down, it is hoped they will be remembered by them,
and her dying counsel taken; which, when she had given, she,
in much sweetness took her leave of them.
And after, said to her husband, '`The Lord has been very good to us,
I desire we may walk worthy; for a little time will finish here,
and I am contented in the Lord`'s will, and hope we shall meet together in heaven,
my dear and tender husband.`'

Another time she said, '`The Lord has often comforted me,
and made my bed a bed of ease to me;`' and then added,
'`I have been wrapped up too much in outward enjoyments, now I am out of them.
I have desired the Lord to search me thoroughly,
that nothing may remain in me that is displeasing to him.
My great care and desire to the Lord has been, that I may hold out to the end.`'
Her husband answered, '`The Lord hears your unfeigned prayers;`' she replied,
'`If Daniel and Moses stood by me, and said it would be well with me,
it would avail nothing, unless I have the witness in myself;`' adding,
'`He that has been my support to this day,
I do hope and believe will be with me to the end;`' and then lay still.
Afterward she said, '`Lord, I beseech you, shorten this great work for your mercy`'s sake,
for your dear Son my mediator`'s sake, if it be your blessed will,
and support me through the valley of the shadow of death, that my faith fail not;
but that an eye of faith may be kept open to look to you.
Lord, you that command the winds and the raging waves of the sea to be still,
and they obey you, are able to make this sick-bed a bed of ease.
Lord, be with me, I beseech you; and then no matter what becomes of this body,
nor what I go through, for there will be an end to that.
Lord, be with me this night, I beseech you, for I am a poor, weak creature; therefore,
O Lord, I beseech you, support me, receive me into your merciful arms,
and lead me into the bride-chamber, where I may forever rest with you.`'

Then she took her husband by the hand,
and earnestly entreated his heart might be to the Lord, and said,
'`Leave off the cares of this life, and seek the Lord above all.`'
Requesting all might be still, she lay down in a sweet state,
desiring to be kept humble at Christ`'s feet.

The day before she was taken speechless,
she told her husband her speech would be taken away, saying, '`For it is the twelfth hour,
and the midnight cry, that the bridegroom is come;`' and said, '`I am satisfied,
my lamp is ready trimmed;`' and farther said, '`Oh!
Jacob`'s God, and Israel`'s king, you are able to do all things,
nothing is too hard for you.
Lord, grant that my passage may be quick and short,
and rather that my tongue may cleave to the roof of my mouth,
than I should speak one word to dishonor you, Lord.
Lord, you know what a night of sorrow and exercise this has been to me;
but you are able to do all things, for if you speak the word, it is done.`'
Then she said to her husband, '`Oh! have your heart to the Lord for me,
and speak to them you know to be honest, good Friends,
to have their hearts to the Lord for me.`'
She then spoke her last words: '`Lord, Lord, Lord, you are Jacob`'s God, and Israel`'s king;
you are a shadow of a mighty rock in a weary land;`' adding, '`Oh!
Zion, Zion, the city of saints`' solemnity, beauty, the beauty of holiness.`'
Then spoke no more, and died some time after, in peace with God, it is not doubted,
and is in his paradise.
She was a virtuous woman, a good wife, a tender mother, and charitable.

She was born the 16th of the Twelfth month, 1658, and died the 1st of the Tenth month,
1708, aged about fifty years;
and was decently buried from the meetinghouse at Horslydown,
and her corpse accompanied to the burying-ground belonging to the same,
by her relations and Friends, who loved her, and lamented the loss of her.

JOHN TAYLOR was born at Sillath, in Abbey-holme, in the county of Cumberland,
in the year 1654, of honest parents,
who educated him with the foremost in that part where he lived.

In the year 1674, the twentieth of his age, he was convinced of the blessed truth,
by the testimony of John Graves, and gladly received the same in the love of it,
and so continued with the people of God,
waiting upon the Lord in silence the space of three years.
Then it pleased the Lord to open his mouth to bear a testimony to the blessed truth,
in which he was very serviceable, both among friends and others at home,
and abroad in Scotland also, where he travelled three or four times;
and had good service in many parts of this nation.
He bore a faithful testimony for the Lord; was sound in doctrine,
and of a good understanding in discipline,
whereby he became very serviceable in monthly and quarterly meetings.
He was a sincere-hearted man, and his deportment and behavior such,
that he had an influence upon all sorts of people,
for his good deportment and meek and quiet spirit.
He met with many trials of various sorts,
and yet was preserved in a meek and even temper,
and he suffered much upon the account of tithes, which he bore with great patience,
and was never known to murmur.

In the year 1708, in the Fourth month, he was visited with sickness,
and then he gave good advice to many who came to see him, both Friends and others.
Being restored to a measure of health, he visited Friends in Yorkshire,
where he had good service for the Lord, and returned in great peace.
About a month after he was taken with the sickness, of which he died;
and in the time of his sickness he was preserved in a sweet frame of spirit,
and had the evidence that he should have a mansion in the Lord`'s house, saying,
'`I feel the spirit of the Lord coming down upon me,
to change me from mortality to immortality;`' and
desired the Lord would make his passage easy,
and he had his desire.
Aged about fifty-four, convinced thirty-four, a minister about thirty-one years.
He died the 8th of the first month, 1709, and was buried at Abbey-holme,
his corpse being accompanied by many friends and others.

WILLIAM ELLIS, of Airton, in Yorkshire, was born the 5th of the Eighth month, 1658,
and convinced of the living and powerful truth in the Third month, 1676.
Being called and qualified by the Lord to be a minister of the gospel of peace and salvation,
he was faithful to his call,
and labored and travelled in the work of the ministry in England, and Ireland,
also in Maryland, Virginia, Carolina, Pennsylvania, New England,
and other parts of America.
A few days before his departure, he said, speaking of his convincement,
'`It was a glorious day to him.
And he had large tokens, that the day of his death would be so likewise.`'
Many sweet and edifying expressions dropped from him, in cheerfulness of mind,
which showed how ready he was to embrace death.

He died on the 4th of the Fourth month, 1709.
Aged nearly fifty-one years.
Convinced of truth about thirty-three years.
He was buried at Friends`' burying-ground, at Airton, and a large meeting there was,
which was eminently attended with the presence of the Lord,
and several living testimonies were there borne,
to the comfort and satisfaction of many.

WILLIAM BARCRAFT, late of Bally-Britton, in King`'s County, in the kingdom of Ireland,
aged twenty-eight years, before his departure, was taken speechless in a violent fit,
but his speech returning again,
he expressed himself thus to his dear wife and mother-in-law, and friends present,
(being in a heavenly frame of mind,
and his pain seeming to them to be taken away,)'`I am exceedingly glad to see you.
The Lord`'s love and mercy is exceedingly great, and this is beyond my expectation,
that I have mercy of the Lord to speak to you.
The presence of the Lord at such a time as this, makes afflictions easy to his people,
and it is an advantage friends have in feeling and enjoying the presence of the Lord.
I am easy to leave this world, in hopes of a glorious time to come,
in the kingdom of eternal peace.
He then desired his mother-in-law to remember his dear love to his father, brother,
sister, relations, and friends, and that as they had bestowed their daughter on him,
now he would bestow, or commend her, and his children to the Lord,
and her tender parents; '`And to my uncle,`' said he,
'`whom I am sure has been tender of me.`'
Then desiring his wife several times, to give him freely up to the Lord,
that he might be easy, he said, '`Who knows, but there may be a service in my going now.
I desire you, (i. e. his wife,) bring up my children in the fear of the Lord,
and in plainness of habit and speech, and in lowliness,
and whether they have little or much, it will be well enough.`'
He further said to her, '`Trust you in the Lord, and keep near to Friends,
and it will be well with you.`'

His wife being in a tender or melted frame of heart, said, '`I do trust in the Lord,
and give you up to him;`' which seemed to give him much satisfaction.
He called his brother-in-law James to him, and warned him to be of a savory life,
and to love the fear of the Lord, and to be careful to keep out of pride and height,
and out of bad company; and added, '`Be sure to walk low and humble,
and be obedient to your parents;
for I never knew any disobedient to their parents do well.
Be sure to tell your brother Joseph to walk low and humble;
and if ever he expects joy and comfort, to be obedient to his mother;
for when I at any time grieved my mother, I was always troubled and sorry for it.
And advise your sister Martha, to have a care of that high city,
(i. e. Dublin,) and be sure to keep low and humble;`' saying,
'`there was great danger in that city, for youth to be led away from the Lord;
but if they served the Lord carefully, it would be well with them.`'

He desired a friend who was present, to tell his brother Thomas,
to be of a sober life and conduct among people,
and to be a good example in the place where he lived,
and in whatever he did he should have an eye to the Lord, and not to be high-minded,
but low and humble.
He said, '`From a child I always loved the company of good honest friends,
for which I was always the better.
Though I have had weary nights and days; yet through all,
I had an eye to the Lord;`' adding,
'`It is a brave thing to have nothing to do but to die.`'
To his wife, he said, '`My dear, comfort yourself, in that it will be well with me.`'
And to his friends that stood by, '`How many precious heavenly meetings have we had;
but it has been a great trouble to me, to see how dull and sleepy some have been,
and others unconcerned, both old and young, in such a glorious day as this is,
where the Lord has appeared so eminently among us.
Many times of late, I thought I saw a more glorious day approaching than ever.
Oh! is not this (speaking of the opportunity he had
with his friends) a precious comfortable thing,
to have this sweet opportunity: this is what my heart desired.
I care not how many young people were here, I should be glad if all the meeting,
and several others were here;`' adding,
'`I wish all the high and lofty ones would look back, and see what they were.`'

All which being spoken in a good sense of the Lord`'s heavenly presence,
did mightily tender Friends`' hearts who stood by,
and ended in prayer and thanksgiving to him who lives forever and ever, Amen.
He gave good ground of hope, that the Lord showed him mercy,
and called him to glory and peace forever.
And when he took leave of friends, he said,
'`I am very easy;`' and departed the 5th of the Sixth month, 1709.

THOMAS BARCRAFT, brother to the aforesaid William Barcraft,
was taken ill of the same distemper upon the 15th of the Eleventh month following.
His uncle and aunt Barcraft sitting by him,
and perceiving him to be under exercise of mind for peace with the Lord,
his uncle inquired of him as to his condition, and he answered as follows:
'`Sometimes I think I shall recover, and other times I think I shall not.
But my desire is, if I recover, to improve my time.
I find most ease in submitting myself to the will of God.
I never wronged any body knowingly, nor acted any gross thing;
but that which is my great trouble, is,
that I did not live so savory a life and conduct as I should have done;
but gave way to lightness that was hurtful to me, of which, if I live,
I hope to warn others.`'
He said to his uncle and aunt,
'`Whenever you reproved me for such things I was always glad of it,
but did not take the notice of it that I now see I ought to have done.
That which seemed but little to me then, now seems a great deal; but if I should live,
and not improve my time, it is best for me to go now,
for I am in hopes there is mercy for me.`'

He departed this life the 18th of the Eleventh month, 1709,
so that he lay sick but three days.
Therefore it is needful for all to improve the present time; fear God, and live soberly,
and to have their conducts coupled therewith, and to take heed to reproof;
not give way to lightness, nor esteem that a little thing;
for it behooves young men and women, and all, to be sober,
and gird up the loins of their minds, and hope to the end.

OLIVER SANSOM, late of Abingdon, formerly of Farrington, in Berkshire,
was convinced of the blessed truth of God in the year 1657,
received it in the love thereof, and was faithful to it.
The Lord having fitted him for his service, and endued him with wisdom, understanding,
and sound judgment, was pleased to call him into the ministry,
to preach and labor in the gospel of Christ and love of God for the good of souls;
which he did freely in this nation and Ireland, and was a valiant sufferer for the truth,
and the testimony thereof, against all swearing and tithes,
and what the Lord raised him up in his power to testify against.
When on his deathbed, a friend came in love to see him, who said,
'`We who are young in years shall greatly miss your
company among us;`' to which Oliver Sansom replied,
'`By reason of my age, it is not likely I shall continue long with you; but be faithful,
as I have been, and you will have the same reward as I am likely to have.
Be followers of Christ, as you have had me for an example,
for I have been true to what the Lord has committed to my charge.`'

He was released, and taken from all his troubles and exercises here below,
and received by the Lord into his paradise the 23rd of the Second month, 1710,
and his body was honorably buried at Abingdon.
Aged about seventy-four years.

SAMUEL WRIGHT, of Welllinborough, in Northamptonshire,
a faithful and honest man whom the Lord called, qualified, commissioned,
and sent freely forth to preach the gospel of life and salvation by Jesus Christ,
was greatly beloved and very serviceable in the country where he lived,
and adorned the doctrine of God our Savior, by a conduct becoming the gospel,
and was of a good repute among his neighbors.

Being visited by the Lord with bodily weakness, and being at a time somewhat better,
he was below stairs, but after a while he went up,
when his wife asked him if he was not spent; he said, '`I feel so much comfort,
and so much of the goodness of the Lord,
I am come up that you may partake of the same with
me;`' and she said she in some measure did,
though under exercise, because of his weakness.
He said to her often, '`Do not trouble and grieve for me,
for the Lord may raise me up still, if he sees it best; if not, be contented,
and put your trust in the Lord; he can make hard things easy.
Is it not better to part from your husband in this condition,
wherein you are satisfied it will be well with him, than if not?`'
His wife replied, '`It will be well with you I am well satisfied,
and that is the greatest comfort I have in parting from you.
But still my loss is the greater, to part with such a good husband, with whom,
if the Lord saw good, it might be as well another time, or some years hence.`'
He answered, '`It must not be another time; the Lord`'s time is the best time.
I should be glad to see you in a mind to submit to the will of the Lord in all things;
for it troubles me to see you so sorrowful.
It will not be your case alone, although I know it will be hard for you to bear.
I would not have you cast yourself down, for then you will not be able to look after me,
and I shall like no body so well.`'

Another time some neighbors came to see him, with whom was a great professor.
They asked him how he was; he answered he was troubled with pain of body,
and sick besides.
They replied, he had been sick a long time.
He said he never thought the time long or tedious, he had so much of the
enjoyment of the presence of the Lord, and felt so much comfort,
that he never thought the time long, nor his afflictions tedious,
saying he was as sensible as in a time of health, and his faith the same as it had been;
and his mind was stayed upon the Lord, and his life was in his hand.
He farther said he had not his work to do;
declaring largely his great satisfaction how happy he should be in the world to come,
saying he had a taste and earnest of it.

Another time, a Friend, with several others, visiting him,
he was much concerned to exhort Friends to love one another,
and to strengthen one another, saying, '`It is well known what labor of love,
and travail of spirit, I have had among you for the service of truth.`'
He expressed the great love of God to his soul, saying, '`What can I desire more;
I am fully satisfied eternal life will be my portion; and the comfort that I feel,
outbalances my pain.`'
He returned praises to the Lord, and was freely resigned up to his will,
saying there were but two things for which he could desire to live, and they were,
for the sake of his family, and upon the service of truth.
He then desired his dear wife not to be too much grieved,
but to be freely resigned to the will of God, saying,
if she had her eye to the Lord he would bless her.
And said farther, '`The Lord who has been and is, my comfort, will be your comfort,
and that is my consolation, and will be your consolation,
for you had not your eye to beauty; you had not your eye to riches;
but your choice was for one that feared the Lord.
Therefore I do believe the Lord had a blessing for you.`'

Being concerned for his dear wife, he added, '`Seeing the Lord provided a husband for you,
according to your desire, can not you say with Job, "`The Lord gives,
and the Lord takes away, blessed be the name of the Lord.`"
Remember what Job said to his wife, "`Shall we receive good at the hand of God,
and shall we not receive evil?`"
For, although the Lord gave you a husband according to your desire,
you are not willing to give him up into his hands; for it would be better for you,
and easier for me.`'
She answered, '`It is too hard for me to do at present;
but the Lord can make hard things easy, if I could put my trust in him.`'
Then he said, '`Remember how it was with Jephtha, who had but one only daughter,
and when he had made a vow, that if the Lord would give him victory over his enemies,
whatsoever came first forth out of his house to meet him, should surely be the Lord`'s;
and the first that came was his daughter;
so he bid her remember the nobility of the damsel; when her father wept to see her,
she said, "`Father, if you have opened your mouth unto the Lord,
do to me according to that which proceeded out of your mouth.`" And she gave up herself,
and can not you give me up?`'

Another time some came to see him, to whom he declared he had great satisfaction to die,
saying, '`I feel the Lord to be with me, and what would the great men of the earth give,
to feel the same peace with God, when they come to lie upon a dying-bed.`'
He uttered many more sweet exhortations to his wife and friends,
to the tendering and affecting of the hearts of those there present; saying,
'`If I find myself weaker in body,
I should be glad to have Friends in general come and see me, to wait upon God together.`'

Another time he said, '`In all the afflictions I ever met with,
my mind was never so stayed as in this,
my mind being so much out of the encumbering things of this world,
that I do believe this affliction will be for my good;`' with much more.

Another time he said he did not know but death might come of a sudden,
but it would be no surprisal to him.
'`I am both ready and willing to die;`' or if it should please the Lord to restore him,
he could be willing to live, for the sake of his family,
or that he might be serviceable in the gospel, for the promotion of truth; but said,
'`I have such satisfaction and full assurance of my future being,
that my heart is often overcome with joy;`' with much more.

At another time he said, '`Lord, you visited me in my youth,
when I was but young in years, and I was given up to serve you; as was stripling David,
when he went to battle against the uncircumcised Philistine;
for he went in the name of the Lord.`'
He also spoke concerning the brazen serpent, how the wounded were to look thereto;
and of Joseph`'s being a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall;
saying, the archers shot at him, but the bow of faith was too strong for them.
Also he said, '`It will be well with me when I am gone to another world,
though I have not death very much in my view.
I have been as though I was at the brink of the grave,
but the Lord has been pleased to spare me a little longer.`'

Another time, friends coming to see him after a meeting, one said to him,
'`You have had a long time of illness;`' he replied, '`I do not think the time long,
by reason I have felt so much of the goodness of the Lord to me.`'
He testified, saying, '`According to my strength, great has been my labor,
and travail in spirit, for the prosperity of Zion, and the welfare of Jerusalem,
since I was exercised with affliction;`' and so bowed down, and went to prayer.

Another time he said to several friends, '`I see the wonders of the Lord in the deep,
and what I now enjoy of the goodness of God, is beyond what I can express.
The Lord has been always with me in my afflictions,
and is still with me;`' with many more sweet expressions, that are not noted.

One asking him at another time how he did, he said, '`I am poorly,
but I think I shall not die at present or suddenly, but I have not my work to do.`'
At another time, about an hour before his departure, being restless as he lay in bed,
his mother said, '`My poor dear child;`' to which he answered,
'`I am rich;`' and so he departed this life, the 29th day of the Third month, 1710.
He was buried in Friends`' burying-ground,
and was accompanied there by many friends and others,
and several good testimonies were then borne unto the truth.

CHRISTOPHER RICHARDSON, late of Burton, in Yorkshire, was born at Caperby,
in the same county, of honest parents, and was religiously educated.

In the time of his weakness of body, which increased so much upon him,
that his recovery was somewhat questioned, his wife speaking to him,
asked him how it was with him?
He answered,
'`It is no light matter to be concerned about our soul`'s salvation;`' but said,
'`I feel hopes to spring.`'
Then taking his wife by the hand, he said, '`My dear,
you have been a loving and obedient wife to me.
I desire you to keep in
patience, the Lord will be a husband to you, and he will provide for you,
he did take care for you before you had a husband.
So he that thus helped you through many troubles
and deep exercises is the same that ever he was;
he will be strength to you in time of weakness.
It was the Lord`'s providence that brought us together;
and he has many times honored us with his presence;
but whether we be separated now or not, the Lord`'s will be done,
for we have had a comfortable time together,
and I desire we may have a comfortable parting, and things may be made easy to you.`'

Then he spoke to his father, and said, '`This I have to say to you,
you have been dear and tender over me, and much concerned about me,
and your care has been to bring me up in truth`'s way;
the Lord will reward you for it in another world.`'

His father replied, '`Child, this I have to say for you,
you have been a dutiful child to me.`'
Then his son said to him again, '`Remember my dear love +++[+++or duty]
to my tender mother, and desire her to keep in patience.`'

Then to his brother John, he said, '`Keep in the fear of the Lord,
let it be always before you, and it will learn you true wisdom.
Love the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and that which inwardly does check and reprove for evil; hearken to that inward voice,
which tells you when you are turning to the right hand, or to the left;
for they that disobey the teachings of it, and will have none of its reproofs,
a day of desolation will overtake them, before they be aware,
and such will be ruined forever.`'
Then taking a brother of his by the hand, he said, '`Farewell,
I do wish your eternal welfare,
and desire you to be faithful to what God has made known to you.
I believe you know enough, give up to the manifestation of the spirit of truth,
and bring your children up in the nurture of it.`'
The brother answered, '`We can do nothing of ourselves,
without God Almighty`'s assistance;`' his reply was,
'`God has extended a measure of his grace to every one to profit withal;
so there will be no pleading of excuse.
I desire you to have a care of giving way to that
which will draw your mind away from the Lord,
for if you do, you will be undone forever, as sure as I hold you by the hand.`'

He also declared he was willing to leave the world, and all that might be enjoyed in it,
if it should please the Lord to take him away at that time,
that he might leave a good savor behind him; signifying the troubles that are here,
and the peace that is with the Lord, and his satisfaction he had in his own particular.
One who was by, said, '`It is well it is so with you;
I am glad to hear such expressions from you.`'
He then said to them about him, '`There are many, when they are brought low in sickness,
begin to consider how they have spent their time, and see their lamps untrimmed,
and lack oil, like the foolish virgins, that are ready to say,
Oh! that it would please the Lord to lengthen their days, so as to raise them up again;
then they would be better prepared for their final change.`'

Then he said, '`I see a portion in the kingdom of heaven,
a place among the sanctified is better than a thousand worlds.
So,`' said he, '`let not the things of this world hinder you; for the cares of this life,
and cumbering things, do but gender to bondage.`'

Then he said, '`My dear love to all my brothers and sisters.
I desire they may be careful to bring up their children in the nurture of truth.`'
Adding, '`Tell my sister Jane from me, that she be not unmindful of her first love;
but that she bow to truth, and stand in the dominion of it, and learn humility,
and prize truth above all.`'

He then remembered his love to some particular friends; and added,
'`My love is to all faithful Friends.`'
His wife asking him how it was with him, he said, '`I am very easy,
the Lord`'s will be done:`' then he ceased to speak any more for a while,
till about three or four hours before he departed; and then he said,
though with a very low voice,
'`Seek Christ Jesus our Savior;`' these were the last words those present could remember.
He was patient in his sickness, and freely resigned to the will of the Lord,
and concerned in love to give advice, as aforesaid,
and declare his sense and experience of the Lord`'s goodness, and salvation by him;
and no doubt is entered into that which,
as he declared to his wife in the early part of his sickness,
is better than outward rest, the paradise of God,
or holy kingdom of eternal life and glory, where his soul will rest in peace forever.

He departed this life the 7th of the Sixth month, 1706, and was buried the 9th,
at Caperby, in Friends`' burying-ground;
being accompanied there by many Friends and neighbors.

ELIZABETH HAYDOCK, daughter of Henry and Martha Haydock, was born at Warrington,
in Lancashire, the 17th of the Sixth month, 1686.
Her father died before she was two years old,
and she was educated among the people of God called Quakers, by her mother,
and was loving and obedient to her till death,
and lived in love and peace with her brother and sister,
and was very affectionate to them, never being known to jar or contend with them.
She was of a kind and courteous behavior to all, by which she gained abundance of love,
both with great and small.
Some time before her death, she labored with her mother,
for her consent that she might go and live with some honest Friend,
to which her mother at last complied, and she went to her beloved uncle, Robert Haydock.
But in a short time, being taken ill, she returned to her mother,
and soon after she came home, said, '`I fully believe I must not recover,
and I am content in the will of God.`'

Her sickness continuing, her mother,
brother and sister were desirous a doctor might be had, which was proposed to her,
and she said, '`To make you easy, I am willing, but I believe he will do me no good,
for I must not recover, I believe.`'
Her mother seeing she grew very weak, asked her how things were with her,
as to her future state in the world to come; she, after some due deliberation, said,
'`My dear mother, I am no ways afraid to die, for things are now well.
I have a very easy mind upon all accounts, and towards every body.
I find nothing stands in my way but you, my tender mother.
I fear it will be hard for you; but be easy, for I am well; and if I live to old age,
I can but be well.
I am given up to die, or to live, as the Lord pleases, since I came to you;
but before I came, I had a hard time.
The enemy would needs have persuaded me that there was little hope for me,
and that I should not find peace, under which I wept, and labored,
none knowing my sorrow I was in, neither did I make it known to any till now.
But I bless God I am now satisfied, and free from any fear, and believe all will be well,
and I shall go to rest; for, dear mother, I see nothing but trouble in the world,
and I do not desire to live in it; we must leave it.`'

Though her weakness continued, and her pain was sharp, she was preserved still and quiet,
and in abundance of patience, and was not heard to murmur in the least, but said,
'`Lord afflict me how you please,
so you will but be pleased to give me patience and an easy passage at last.`'
Then she lay still some time, and after said to her mother,
being then under a deep travail of spirit, because of her sore affliction,
'`Let us pray to the Lord.`'
Soon after, her mother knelt down, and prayed to the Lord for her,
and freely resigned her up to him, that his will might be done in and with her;
after which she was pretty easy in herself, and said, '`Oh! dear mother,
I once thought I never should have come to that experience I now have.
I now know a stay to my mind, and silence to my own thoughts.
I am at times quit of all thoughts of the things of this world.`'
Her mother being weeping by her, she said, '`Weep not, my tender mother,
it is better for me to die, than to live;`' her mother said,
'`If it be the will of the Lord,
I desire none of mine might die of such a lingering distemper, as now you are under,
your pain is so great.`'
She replied, '`Do not desire so, for it is sad for youth to be quickly snapped away,
and not have time to remember their latter end; it has been good to me.`'

About two weeks before she died, she took her bed,
for the most of which time she uttered many sweet and sensible expressions.
One time her mother withdrew from her into another room, yet in her hearing,
and heard her say unto the Lord, '`All might,
power and glory is with you;`' and continued pouring forth her spirit unto God, saying,
'`Lord, I am ready.
Oh! tarry not sweet Lord.
Oh! deliverance, deliverance, I cry to you for.
Oh!
God, deliver my soul.
I feel nothing to hinder; but, oh!
Lord, if any thing be in my way remove it, oh! my God.`'
Afterward said to her mother, '`I fear you hold me, oh! do not so; neither weep for me,
for my tears are dried up.
I feel no cause for any; neither mourn for me, for I shall go to rest.
I had rather be with Almighty God, than enjoy all this world, it is nothing to me.`'

At another time, when her mother and relations thought her near going,
recovering a little strength, she kissed her mother, father, brother, and sisters,
and said, '`Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
I am ready, tarry not, but deliver me out of my pain.`'
Her mother said, '`The Lord is supplicated for you, and your deliverance draws near,
I do believe, and your time will not be long; my spirit is earnest with yours,
that he may ease you; but it is the Lord, he must do what he pleases; breathe you to him,
my dear child, for patience.`'
She replied, '`Poor Job had it, and the Lord has given it me all along,
and I hope he will give it me still.`'
She desired that her ever dear friend, Benjamin Bangs, might be sent for; and he was,
and came.
After he had been some time with her, she fixed her eyes upon him steadfastly, and said,
'`My pain is very great, pray you to the Lord for me;`' and was very still a while,
in which time the spirit of prayer from God came upon him,
and he prayed both powerfully and with much fervency of spirit to the Almighty for her,
that it might please him to ease her of her pain.
And the Lord was entreated for her, and in a little time her pain was wholly taken away;
and she said, '`I bless the Lord, I am easy, both in body and mind.
I have nothing to do, but wait the Lord`'s time.`'

That night she had some rest, and lay very still, and free from pain;
and in the night said to her mother, '`My dear love is with you.
I love you above all the world; and my love to all my dear relations,
I shall see them no more, and to my weak aunt at Penketh,
who was kind to me when I was there.`'
Next day she said to her mother, with a cheerful countenance, '`Dear mother,
I have now done, four or twelve of the clock, I think I shall not pass that time.
Be easy and content, or else your time will be but short.
There is nothing in all this world has been so dear to me as you;
but I hope you can not desire my stay.`'
Her mother asked her if she was sensible of her coldness; she replied, '`Yes,
and of my sweating too, and if it is death`'s sweat, it is welcome to me.
Let it be so to you, dear mother.
The Lord Jesus is my Savior, I can embrace death with open arms, it is welcome,
I fear nothing.
I have sometimes heard you, and some other Friends say in meetings, that the dead,
though ever so lovely when alive, were in no wise pleasant to the living, when dead.
I am partly dead, and must be buried out of your sight.
The Lord be with our spirits, and bless you all.`'
She went away like a lamb, innocently, the 8th of the Sixth month, 1710,
and was buried the 13th of the same,
being attended to her grave by many Friends and others.
Aged eight days short of twenty-four years.

JOHN BANKS was born in the year 1637, in Sunderland, in the parish of Issell,
in the county of Cumberland, of honest parents, his father a fell-monger and glove-maker.
At sixteen years of age, he was, by the great power and pure spirit of God,
and the revelation thereof, in and through the Lord Jesus Christ, in his heart,
brought to the knowledge of God, and the way of his blessed truth,
before ever he heard any one called Quaker preach;
and in himself was directed to go to the meeting of the said people, it being shown him,
and signified to him they were the Lord`'s people.
So he went the next first day to a meeting of the aforesaid people at Pardshaw,
where very few words were spoken; but a paper was therein read,
which was suitable to his condition;
and through waiting diligently in the light of Christ, and keeping to the power of God,
he came to experience the work thereof, and freedom from bondage,
through faithfulness to the Lord.

In the year 1663, being qualified by the Lord,
he was drawn in his spirit to visit some neighboring counties,
and labored in the work of the ministry.

In the year 1668, being farther grown in the truth, he was made willing to forsake all,
to answer the Lord`'s requirings,
and he travelled into the south and west of England in the Lord`'s service.
After that, from year to year he labored zealously to preach the gospel of peace,
not only in England, but Scotland and Ireland; he crossed the sea twelve times,
and often with great difficulty and danger of life by sea, in great tempests and storms,
and by robbers on land.
He was made instrumental to turn many by his zealous labors in the gospel of God,
to righteousness, who remain witnesses of the same, and seals of his ministry.
He had much suffering by loss of goods, imprisonment, and hardships therein;
which he was enabled to go through, for the Lord was with him, and supported him,
and blessed his labors; so that many, both men and women,
were convinced and confirmed in the truth by him, and became faithful and able ministers,
and so continued until death, and others yet remain.

In the year 1696 he married his second wife at Glastonbury in Somersetshire,
settled at Mear, until about two years before his death he removed to Street,
in the said county.
He likewise was concerned, in the love of God, a month or two before his death,
notwithstanding his age and weakness, to visit Friends at several of their meetings,
and had comfortable seasons with them, both at their meetings of public worship,
and at their monthly meetings,
held to take care of the poor and fatherless children and widows;
for he was zealous for good order and Christian discipline in the church,
and that those things that were honest, just, pure, and of good report,
and that had any praise in them, should be followed.
Indeed, it was admirable to those who knew him, and the weak condition he was in,
how in his last journey at Somerton, he was in the meeting, which was very large,
enabled to preach nearly an hour and a half, and bore a sound testimony to truth,
and against outside shows, that lacked substance, with much presence of mind,
and with good distinction in his doctrine; the which gave demonstration,
not only of the strength of his memory and quick understanding,
but sound judgment in things spiritual.
His preaching was comfortable, refreshing, and edifying to the meeting;
and he earnestly pressed Friends to be faithful to the small appearance of truth,
encouraging such as were weak, on whom Amalek chooses to vent his malice,
to a holy zeal.

After meeting, it was sufficient task for two men to lead him to his quarters,
though he was very cheerful,
and signified his great satisfaction in his service and travail,
and next went to Friends`' meeting at Puddimore, and after to a meeting at Yeovill,
where many Friends were.
In his public service there,
he was very lively and quick in discerning the states of several,
and afterward returned home, where, in the Seventh month, 1710,
he was taken with great pain in his back; yet he often said, '`Though my pain is great,
my soul does magnify the Lord for his goodness towards me;`' adding,
'`He has provided a good place for me in heaven.`'

On the 22nd of the Seventh month 1710, several Friends being present,
after some time of waiting in silence upon the Lord, he said these words,
or to this effect:

'`Dear friends, I counsel you in the love and fear of God,
to keep your meetings for the worship and service of God, both First-days and week-days,
(mind that), and also monthly and quarterly meetings,
which were set up by the power of God, to keep things in good order among us.`'
Farther he said, '`My love has been so great to Friends at Glastonbury and Street,
that I have ventured my life in riding through deep waters to visit them,
when I have had a concern from God upon my mind: so that you can say,
I have been a good example to you in keeping to meetings, as well as in other things.`'

Then he said, '`Although I am weak in body,
and do not know whether I may live much longer or not, yet I do not see death at present.
However, I am strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,
and have nothing to do but to die, for I am rich in faith and good works towards God,
and my cup is full of the love of God.
Whether I live or die, it will be well with my soul; for, blessed be the Lord, I can say,
with the wise and holy Apostle Paul, that I have fought a good fight,
I have kept the faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.
And did the apostle say for himself only?
No, he was wiser than so, but to all them that love his appearing.`'

Some Friends of Somerton taking their leave of him, he said to them,
'`Give my dear love to Friends at Somerton, and tell them that my soul is alive unto God.`'
To a young man of that place, lately convinced, dear John Banks said,
'`Are you the young man that lives at Somerton, lately convinced of the blessed truth?`'
he answered, '`Yes.`'
'`The Lord,`' said John Banks, '`be with you; and I desire you, in his love,
to give up in obedience to the working of the Spirit of God in your heart,
and then he will do great and glorious things for you.
And do not you stumble at the cross; for the more you look at it, and put it off,
the harder it will be for you to take it up.`'

To another Friend, when he took him by the hand at parting, he said,
'`My dear love to you, and all that are faithful unto God.`'

To another that bade him farewell, he answered, '`I do fare well in the Lord;
my love is to you, and all the faithful in Christ;`' adding, '`Joseph is yet alive,
and that is enough.`'
Then he earnestly desired Friends to keep in the unity of the spirit,
which is the bond of peace.

A great deal more good advice,
in the living and eternal power of the great eternal God that attended him, he gave,
which is not noted; but at the delivery thereof, the hearts of many were tendered,
and tears ran down from their eyes.

On the 24th of the Seventh month, a Friend, visiting him, asked him how it was with him;
he answered, '`Very sick, and full of pain in my feet and legs, thighs and bowels;
but the Lord helps me, else I should cry out aloud; truth helps me, and ever has,
since I believed in it.`'

The day he died, being the 6th of the Eighth month, 1710, and Sixth day of the week,
he said to a Friend, '`It is well with me, and I have nothing to do but to die;`' and said,
'`I shall end in truth as I began.`'
So had an easy passage hence, and after all his labors, sufferings, and travels,
is entered into rest;
and there is no doubt of his portion in the everlasting kingdom of eternal glory forever,
to sound forth praises and hallelujahs unto the Lord God,
and the Lamb that sits upon the throne, who is worthy.

He was honorably buried in Friends`' burying-ground at Street, in Somersetshire,
the 12th of the Eighth month, 1710.
Aged seventy-three, convinced fifty-seven, and a minister forty-seven years.
