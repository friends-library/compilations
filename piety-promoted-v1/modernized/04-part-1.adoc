JAMES PARNELL, born at Retford, in Nottinghamshire,
was a young man who received the blessed truth early.
About the year 1654, he visited George Fox, who was at that time a prisoner in Carlisle,
where he disputed with, and confuted, many priests and others;
and afterwards travelled southward, preaching truth,
and disputing with its opposers in Huntingtonshire, the Isle of Ely,
and some parts in Cambridgeshire, being then in the eighteenth year of his age.

He was the first called a Quaker who preached the gospel in the county of Essex, namely,
at Stebbing, Felsted, Witham, Coggeshall, Halsted, etc.,
by whose ministry many thousands were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ.

About the middle of summer, 1655, he came to Colchester, and on the next day,
being the first-day of the week,
he preached the gospel to thousands of people in that town, first at his lodging,
then at the public parish place of worship,
and then in a great meeting appointed on purpose.
After that he disputed with the town-lecturer,
and with another priest in the French school.
All this was in one day;
in which the wisdom and patience of Christ appeared very gloriously,
for the convincing of many who believed; and he put to silence, by his sound doctrine,
the gainsayers.
But some hardened their hearts, others beat him with their fists and staves,
as particularly one, who struck him with a great staff as he came out of a steeple-house,
and said, '`There, take that for Christ Jesus`'s sake:`' to which he returned this answer,
'`Friend, I do receive it for Jesus Christ his sake.`'
And many other intolerable affronts they offered him.

After he had labored in Colchester, he went back to Coggeshall,
where the professors had appointed a fast.
From there he was committed to Colchester Castle,
and then had in irons to Chelmsford assizes, and there was fined forty pounds,
and committed back again to Colchester.
Here they allowed none to come to him but such as came to scorn, abuse, and beat him;
not allowing him at some times to have food brought to him,
and at other times took the food away when it was brought to him;
and forced him to lie on the stones, which in wet seasons would run down with water.
Then they put him into a hole in the wall, high from the ground,
where the ladder was too short by six feet,
not permitting his victuals to be brought to him,
nor he to draw it up with a basket and a cord, which his friends had provided,
but he must either come down by a rope, or famish in the hole.

After long suffering in this hole,
it having no place either for the air or smoke to pass out,
his limbs were so much benumbed, that one day climbing up to the top of the ladder,
and catching at the rope with his other hand, he missed it,
and fell from a very great height down upon the stones,
whereby he was exceedingly wounded in his head and body, and taken up for dead.
After that they put him into another little hole called the Oven (some ovens more broad),
where they would not allow him to have charcoal, neither would they accept of bail,
nor body for body, which his friends offered, that he might recover of his hurts.
One day, the door being open, he did but once get out of that nasty close hole,
and walk for a little air into a stinking yard before the door,
when the jailor came in a rage and locked up the hole,
and shut him out in the yard all night, being in the coldest time in all the winter.
By these cruelties he grew weaker and weaker,
finding no mercy at the hands of his enemies.
Near his departure he said (being all along borne up in much patience),
'`Here I die innocently:`' and further said, '`Now I must go:`' and turned his head,
and said, '`This death I must die:
I have seen glorious things;`' and to his friends about him, '`Will you hold me?`'
One of them said, '`Dear heart, we will not hold you.`'
Then he said, '`Now I will go:`' and stretching himself out,
fell into a sweet sleep for about an hour (as he often had said,
one hour`'s sleep would cure him of all), and so drew breath no more.
He died about the nineteenth year of his age, in the year 1656.

JOHN CAMM, born at Cam`'s-gill, within the barony of Kendal,
in the county of Westmoreland, was a man inclined to religion of the strictest sort,
from his childhood.
He, with many more, who sought after the best things,
separated themselves from the national worship of those times,
and met apart at a place called Firbank chapel, and other places,
among which people he was sometimes a preacher.
But in the year 1652, he was (with many hundreds of the congregation,
among whom were John Audland, Francis Howgill, Edward Burrough,
and Richard Hubberthorn) convinced of the truth,
by the preaching of that servant of the Lord, George Fox.
He submitted to the mighty power of the Lord,
and the operation of his blessed Spirit in his heart,
and was made willing to take up the cross,
and forsake the glory and friendship of the world; and after a day of great trouble,
through the spirit of judgment and burning,
wherein he found the old heavens and earth to pass away; even as a prepared vessel,
the Lord filled him with his power, and put his word into his mouth,
and sent him forth to publish the same;
and he was obedient and travelled into all the northern counties,
to the borders of Scotland, and from there to London, in company with Francis Howgill,
with a message from the Lord to Oliver Cromwell, then protector.

After his return from London into the north he, with John Audland, Francis Howgill,
Edward Burrough, and Richard Hubberthorn, went southward;
John Camm and Edward Burrough traveling through the middle of the nation,
the others through other parts, and they met together at London,
with several other of their brethren.

After some time, John Camm and John Audland were called towards Bristol,
where an effectual door was opened to them, and many hundreds were,
by their word and testimony which they published, turned to God.

John Camm was naturally of a weak constitution of body,
and by the daily travels that he underwent, spent his strength exceedingly,
and had a violent cough a considerable time before his death.
He was a man richly furnished with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, patient in exercises,
grave in behavior, profound in judgment, quick in discerning,
and a sharp reprover of wickedness, hypocrisy,
and of disorderly walkers in the profession of truth.
Unity of brethren was his soul`'s delight; his ministry weighty and deep,
not pleasant to itching ears, but reached the witness of God;
careful not to make the gospel chargeable, having an estate of his own;
and often suffered the spoiling of his goods joyfully,
in a faithful testimony against tithes.

He would often call his children together, and exhort them to fear the Lord;
and would wonderfully praise God for his goodness,
counting his bodily weakness a happiness,
being sanctified unto him by that word which had sanctified his soul;
under the sense of which he would say, '`How great a benefit do I enjoy beyond many.
I have such a large time of preparation for death, being daily dying,
that I may live forever with my God in that kingdom that is unspeakably full of glory.
My outward man daily wastes and moulders down, and draws towards its place and center;
but my inward man revives and mounts upwards towards
its place and habitation in the heavens.`'

The morning he departed this life, he called his wife, children and family,
and gave them seasonable instruction to love the Lord, and his way, and truth,
and to walk in the same, saying, his glass was run; the time of his departure was come;
he was to enter into everlasting ease, joy and rest;
charging them all to be patient and content in parting with him.
So, presently fainting, he passed quietly away as into a sweet sleep,
whereupon some about him did weep aloud; at which he was awakened as out of a sleep,
and desired to be helped a little upon his bed, saying,
'`My dear hearts you have wronged me, and disturbed me, for I was at sweet rest.
You should not passionately sorrow for my departure.
This house of clay must go to its place,
but this soul and spirit is to be gathered up to the Lord, to live with him forever,
where we shall meet with everlasting joy.`'
So, again taking his leave of every one of them,
charging them to be content with his departure, he lay down,
and in a little time departed this life.
He was convinced in 1652, and died in 1656, being aged about fifty-two years.

WILLIAM ROBINSON, of London, merchant, and Marmaduke Stevenson, of Yorkshire, husbandman,
both suffered martyrdom for their obedience to God,
in bearing their testimony to his blessed truth in New England,
on the 27th of the Eighth month, 1659.

When they were brought before the court of Boston in New England,
on the 20th of the said month, the governor said to them, '`We have made laws,
and endeavored several ways to keep you from us, and neither whipping, nor imprisonments,
nor cutting off ears, nor banishment upon pain of death, will keep you from among us.
Give ear, and hearken to your sentence: You shall go to the place from which you came,
and from there to the gallows, and be hanged till you are dead.`'

Accordingly the said William Robinson and Marmaduke Stevenson, with Mary Dyer,
were taken out of prison; who having parted with their friends in prison,
full of the joy of the Lord, who had counted them worthy to suffer for his name,
and having embraced each other with fervency of love and gladness of heart,
in peace with God, were led to the place of execution the back way,
lest their innocent sufferings should too much affect the people;
and when they attempted to speak,
their cruel persecutors caused the drums to be beaten to drown their voice.

One of their chief preachers, meeting the said sufferers going to be executed,
said tauntingly, and shaking his head in a scoffing manner,
'`Shall such jacks as you come in before authority, with your hats on?`'
To which William Robinson said to the people, '`Mind you,
it is for not putting off our hats that we are put to death.`'
When he was upon the ladder, he spoke to the people thus;
that they suffered not as evil-doers,
but as those who testified and manifested the truth,
and that this was the day of their visitation;
and therefore desired them to mind the light that was in them,
which was the Light of Christ; of which they testified,
and were now going to seal it with their blood.
So the executioner put William Robinson to death, and afterwards Marmaduke Stevenson,
who both of them died full of the joy of the Lord, and stood fast in him,
sealing their testimony with their blood,
their countenances not changing when the halters were about their necks.

Their enemies not permitting their bodies to be taken down, cut them down,
and the fall broke the skull of William Robinson;
and with their knives they ripped off their shirts,
and dragged their naked bodies into a hole,
not allowing their friends to take them away and bury them;
and afterwards when a friend brought pales to enclose the ground,
that the brute beasts might not prey on their bodies, it was denied him;
and their bodies were left in a pit in the open field,
which was soon covered with water.

Here follows a copy of William Robinson`'s paper, offered to the court,
before he was sentenced to death, concerning their coming into those parts,
for which they were put to death; which was denied by the governor to be read.

--

On the 8th day of the Eighth month, 1659, in the after part of the day,
in traveling between Newport in Rhode Island and Daniel Gould`'s house,
with my dear brother Christopher Holder, the Word of the Lord came expressly to me,
which did fill me immediately with life and power, and heavenly love,
by which he constrained me, and commanded me to pass to the town of Boston,
my life to lay down in his will, for the accomplishing of his service,
that he had there to perform at the day appointed.
To which heavenly voice I presently yielded obedience,
not questioning the Lord how he would bring the thing to pass, being I was a child,
and obedience was demanded of me by the Lord,
who filled me with living strength and power from his heavenly presence,
which at that time did mightily overshadow me,
and my life at that time did say amen to what the Lord required of me,
and had commanded me to do, and willingly I was given up from that time to this day,
the will of the Lord to do and perform, whatever became of my body.

For the Lord had said unto me, my soul shall live in everlasting peace,
and my life shall enter into rest, for being obedient to the God of my life.
I being a child, dared not question the Lord in the least,
but rather willing to lay down my life than to bring dishonor to the Lord.
And as the Lord made me willing, dealing gently and kindly with me,
as a tender father by a faithful child whom he tenderly loves,
so the Lord did deal with me, in ministering his life unto me,
which gave and gives me strength to perform what the Lord required of me.
And still as I did and do stand in need,
he ministered and ministers more strength and virtue, and heavenly power and wisdom,
whereby I was and am made strong in God,
not fearing what man shall be allowed to do unto me, being filled with heavenly courage,
which is meekness and innocence, for the cause is the Lord`'s that we go in,
and the battle is the Lord`'s; and thus says the Lord of Hosts,
the mighty and the terrible God, "`Not by strength, nor by might, nor by power of man,
but by my Spirit,`" says the Lord of Hosts.
'`I will perform what my mouth has spoken, through my servants, whom I have chosen;
my elect, in whom my soul delights.`'

Friends, the God of my life, and the God of the whole earth, did lay this thing upon me,
for which I now suffer bonds near unto death.
He, by his Almighty power, and everlasting love, constrained me,
and laid this thing upon me, and truly I could not deny the Lord,
much less resist the Holy One of Israel.
Therefore all who are ignorant of the motion of the Lord in the inward parts,
be not hasty in judging in this matter, lest you speak evil of the thing you know not.
Of a truth, the Lord God of heaven and earth commanded me by his spirit,
and spoke unto me by his Son, whom he has made heir of all things,
and in his life I live, and in it I shall depart this earthly tabernacle,
if unmerciful men be allowed to take it from me.

Herein I rejoice, that the Lord is with me, the Ancient of Days,
the Life of the suffering Seed, for which I am freely given up,
and singly do I stand in the will of God; for to me to live is Christ,
and to die is gain.
Truly I have great desire and will herein, knowing that the Lord is with me,
whatever ignorant men shall be able to say against me;
for the witness of the spirit I have received,
and the presence of the Lord and his heavenly life accompany me,
so that I can say in truth, and from an upright heart,
Blessed be the Lord God of my life, who has counted me worthy, and called me hereunto,
to bear my testimony against ungodly and unrighteous men,
who seek to take away the life of the righteous without a cause;
as the rulers of Massachusetts Bay do intend,
if the Lord stop them not from their intent.

Oh! hear you rulers, and give ear and listen,
all you that have any hand herein to put the innocent to death, for in the name,
and fear, and dread of the Lord God,
I here declare the cause of my staying here among you,
and continuing in the jurisdiction after there was
a sentence of banishment upon pain of death,
as you said, pronounced against me without a just cause;
as you all know that we that were banished committed nothing worthy of banishment,
nor of any punishment, much less banishment upon pain of death.
And now, you rulers, you do intend to put me to death, and my companion,
unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying,
Go to Boston with your brother William Robinson.
Unto which command he was obedient, who had said unto him,
he had a great work for him to do.
This thing is now seen, and the Lord is now doing it; and it is in obedience to the Lord,
the God of the whole earth, that we continued among you,
and that we came to the town of Boston again, in obedience to the Lord,
the Creator of heaven and earth, in whose hand your breath is.
Will you put us to death for obeying the Lord, the God of the whole earth?
Well, if you do this act, and put us to death, know this, and be it known unto you all,
you rulers and people within this jurisdiction,
that whosoever has an hand therein will be guilty of innocent blood.
Not only upon yourselves will you bring innocent blood, but upon the town,
and the inhabitants thereof, and everywhere within this jurisdiction,
that had the least hand therein.
Therefore be instructed, you rulers of this land, and take warning betimes,
and learn wisdom, before it be hid from your eyes.

Written in the common jail the 19th of the Eighth month, 1659, in Boston,
by one who fears the Lord, who is by ignorant people called a Quaker,
and unto such am I only known by the name of William Robinson,

Here follows a copy of Marmaduke Stevenson`'s paper

given forth by him a little before he was put to death,

In the beginning of the year 1655, I was at the plough in the east parts of Yorkshire,
in old England, near the place where my outward being was.
And as I walked after the plough,
I was filled with the love and presence of the living God,
which did ravish my heart when I felt it;
for it did increase and abound in me like a living stream,
so did the life and love of God run through me like
a precious ointment giving a pleasant smell,
which made me to stand still.
As I stood a little still, with my heart and mind stayed upon the Lord,
the word of the Lord came to me in a still small voice, which I did hear perfectly,
saying to me, in the secret of my heart and conscience,
I have ordained you a prophet unto the nations.
At the hearing of the word of the Lord I was put to a stand,
seeing that I was but a child for such a weighty matter.

So, at the time appointed, Barbados was set before me,
unto which I was required of the Lord to go, and leave my dear and loving wife,
and tender children; for the Lord said unto me, immediately by his Spirit,
that he would be as a husband to my wife, and as a father to my children,
and they should not lack in my absence, for he would provide for them when I was gone.
I believed the Lord would perform what he had spoken,
because I was made willing to give up myself to his work and service,
to leave all and follow him, whose presence and life is with me,
where I rest in peace and quietness of spirit, with my dear brother,
under the shadow of His wings,
who has made us willing to lay down our lives for his name`'s sake,
if unmerciful men be allowed to take them from us; and if they do,
we know we shall have peace and rest with the Lord forever in his holy habitation,
when they shall have torment night and day.

In obedience to the living God,
I made preparation to pass to Barbados in the fourth month, 1658.
After some time that I had been on the said island in the service of God,
I heard that New England had made a law to put the servants of the living God to death,
if they returned after they were sentenced away, which did come near me at that time;
and as I considered the thing, and pondered it in my heart,
immediately came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
'`You know not but you may go there.`'
I kept this word in my heart, and did not declare it to any until the time appointed.
So after that, a vessel was got ready for Rhode Island, which I passed in.

After a little time that I had been there, visiting the seed which the Lord had blessed,
the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
'`Go to Boston with your brother William Robinson;`' and at his command I was obedient,
and gave up to his will, that so his work and service may be accomplished:
for he had said unto me, that he had a great work for me to do,
which is now come to pass.
For yielding obedience to, and for obeying the voice and command of the Everlasting God,
which created heaven and earth, and the fountains of waters, do I, with my dear brother,
suffer outward bonds, near unto death.
And this is given forth to be upon record, that all people may know who hear it,
that we came not in our own wills, but in the will of God.

Given forth by me, who am known to men by the name of Marmaduke Stevenson;
but have a new name given me, which the world knows not of,
written in the Book of Life.

MARY DYER, a faithful woman, fearing God,
the wife of a husband of good estate in Rhode Island, and mother of several children,
was also condemned to death at the same time with William Robinson and Marmaduke Stevenson.
When she received the sentence,
that she should be hanged at the place of execution till she was dead, she replied,
'`The will of the Lord be done.`'
Then the governor saying take her away, she answered, '`Yes,
joyfully shall I go;`' and was led to the place of execution between her two fellow-sufferers,
William Robinson and Marmaduke Stevenson.
One of her enemies upbraiding her therewith, she replied,
'`It is the greatest joy and honor I can enjoy in this world;`' adding these words,
'`No eye can see, no ear can hear, no tongue can speak, no heart can understand,
the sweet incomes and refreshings of the spirit of the Lord which I now enjoy.`'
Having seen her two friends die before her face, and giving herself up to die also,
her hands and feet being tied, and her face covered, with the halter about her neck,
she was even with the Lord in joy and peace, an order came for her reprieve,
upon the petition of her son; which being read, and the halter taken off, and she loosed,
was desired to come down; but she tarrying to wait upon the Lord to know his mind,
they pulled her down with the ladder, and had her to prison,
and next morning she was carried out of the country towards Rhode Island.
And as a lively testimony of the virtue of truth, which can look death in the face,
and to be a record to future generations, how truth has conquered in a woman,
is here inserted Mary Dyer`'s letter, which she wrote the day after her reprieve,
as follows:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

[.signed-section-context-open]
The 28th of the Eighth Month, 1659.

Once more to the general court assembled in Boston, speaks Mary Dyer, even as before.
My life is not accepted, neither avails me,
in comparison of the lives and liberty of the truth and servants of the living God,
for which, in the bowels of love and meekness I sought you; yet, nevertheless,
with wicked hands have you put two of them to death, which makes me to feel,
that the mercies of the wicked are cruelty.
I rather choose to die than to live, as from you, as guilty of their innocent blood.

Therefore, seeing my request is hindered,
I leave you to the righteous Judge and searcher of all hearts,
who with the pure measure of light he has given every man to profit withal,
will in his due time let you see whose servants you are,
and of whom you have taken counsel, which I desire you to search into.
But all his counsel has been slighted, and you would none of his reproofs.
Read your portion; for verily the night comes on quickly, wherein no man can work,
in which you shall assuredly fall to your own master.
In obedience to the Lord, whom I serve with my spirit, and in pity to your souls,
which you neither know nor pity,
I can do no less than once more warn you to put away the evil of your doings,
and kiss the Son, the light in you, before his wrath be kindled in you.
For where it is, nothing without you can help or deliver you out of his hand at all,
and if these things be not so, then say,
there has been no prophet from the Lord among you: though we be nothing,
yet it is his pleasure, by things that are not, to bring to nought things that are.

When I heard your last order read, it was a disturbance to me,
that was so freely offering up my life to him that gave it me, and sent me here so to do.
This obedience being his own work, he gloriously accompanied with his presence,
and peace, and love in me, in which I rested from my labor,
till by your order and the people I was so far disturbed,
that I could not retain any more of the words thereof,
than that I should return to prison and there remain forty and eight hours,
to which I submitted, finding nothing from the Lord to the contrary,
that I may know what his pleasure and counsel is concerning me, on whom I wait therefore;
for he is my life, and length of my days; and as I said before, I came at his command,
and go at his command.

Mary Dyer being thus freed as aforesaid, returned to Rhode Island,
where her husband and children dwelt, and after some stay with them,
she went towards Long Island, and was at Shelter Island,
and had good service for the Lord; where she thought she might pass home to Rhode Island:
but she was moved of the Lord to return to Boston again,
and she came there on the 21st of the Third month, 1660.
On the 31st of the same she was sent for to the general court,
where the governor said to her,

[.discourse-part]
_Governor:_ Are you the same Mary Dyer that was here the last general sessions?

[.discourse-part]
_Mary Dyer:_ I am the same Mary Dyer.

[.discourse-part]
_Governor:_ You will own yourself a Quaker, will you not?

[.discourse-part]
_Mary Dyer:_ I own myself to be so reproachfully called.

[.discourse-part]
_Governor:_ The sentence was passed upon you the last general court, and now likewise;
you must return to the prison from which you came,
and there remain till tomorrow at nine o`'clock,
then from there you must go to the gallows, and there be hanged till you are dead.

[.discourse-part]
_Mary Dyer:_ This is no more than what you said before.

[.discourse-part]
_Governor:_ And now it is to be executed;
therefore prepare yourself tomorrow at nine o`'clock.

[.discourse-part]
_Mary Dyer:_ I came in obedience to the will of God to the last general court,
desiring you to repeal your unrighteous laws of banishment upon pain of death,
and that same is my work now, and earnest request,
because you refused before to grant me my request; although I told you,
that if you refused to repeal them,
the Lord would send other of his servants to witness against them.

[.discourse-part]
_Governor:_ Are you a prophet?

[.discourse-part]
_Mary Dyer:_ I spoke the words that the Lord spoke in me.

And beginning to speak of the call of the Lord to her, the governor said, '`Away with her,
away with her.`'
So she was had to prison, and kept close till the next day at the ninth hour,
when the marshal called hastily for her; to whom she mildly replied, '`Stay a little;
I shall be ready presently.`'
But he cruelly replied, he could not wait upon her.
So he had her away with a company of soldiers, beating a drum before and behind,
that they might not hear her speak; and being upon the ladder at the place of execution,
some said to her, if she would return, she might save herself.

[.discourse-part]
_Mary Dyer:_ No, I cannot; for in obedience to the will of the Lord God I came,
and in his will I abide faithful unto death.

[.offset]
A priest called out to her, '`Mary Dyer, O repent, repent.`'

[.discourse-part]
_Mary Dyer:_ No, man; I am not now to repent.

[.offset]
One said that she should say that she had been in paradise.

[.discourse-part]
_Mary Dyer:_ Yes, I have been in paradise several days.

And more she spoke concerning her eternal happiness.
So, sweetly and cheerfully in the Lord she finished her testimony,
and died a faithful martyr of Jesus Christ, the 1st of the Fourth month, 1660.

Here follows the copy of a letter that Mary Dyer sent to the rulers of Boston,
after she had received sentence of death.

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

[.salutation]
To the General Court in Boston.

Whereas I am by many charged with guiltiness of my own blood:
if you mean in my coming to Boston, I am therein clear, and justified by the Lord,
in whose will I came, who will require my blood of you be sure,
who have made a law to take away the lives of the innocent servants of God,
if they come among you, who are called by you cursed Quakers; although I say,
and am a living witness for them and the Lord, that he has blessed them,
and sent them unto you.
Therefore be not found fighters against God,
but let my counsel and request be accepted with you, to repeal all such laws,
that the truth and servants of the Lord may have free passage among you,
and you be kept from shedding innocent blood,
which I know there are many among you would not do, if they knew it so to be.
Nor can the enemy, that stirs you up thus to destroy this holy seed,
in any measure countervail the great damage that you will by thus doing procure.

Therefore, seeing the Lord has not hid it from me, it lies upon me,
in love to your souls, thus to persuade you.
I have no self-ends, the Lord knows, for if my life were freely granted by you,
it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you,
so long as I should daily hear or see the sufferings of these people, my dear brethren,
with whom my life is bound up, as I have done these two years;
and now it is like to increase even unto death, for no evil doing, but coming among you.
Were ever the like laws heard of among a people that profess Christ come in the flesh?
Have such no other weapons but such laws to fight with against spiritual wickedness,
as you call it?
Woe is me for you!
Of whom take you counsel?
Search with the light of Christ in you, and it will show you of whom, as it has done me,
and many more, who have been disobedient and deceived, as now you are.
As you come into this light, and obey what is made manifest to you therein,
you will not repent that you were kept from shedding blood, though by a woman.

It is not my own life I seek (for I choose rather to suffer with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of Egypt), but the life of the seed,
which I know the Lord has blessed;
and therefore the enemy thus vehemently seeks to destroy the life thereof,
as in all ages he ever did.
Oh! hearken not unto him, I beseech you, for the seed`'s sake, which is one in all,
and is dear in the sight of God, which they that touch, touch the apple of his eye,
and cannot escape his wrath; whereof I having felt,
cannot but persuade all men that I have to do withal; especially you,
who name the name of Christ, to depart from such iniquity as shedding blood,
even of the saints of the Most High.

Let my request have as much acceptance with you, if you be Christians,
as Esther`'s had with Ahasuerus,
whose relation is short of that which is between Christians,
and my request is the same that her`'s was; and he said not that he had made a law,
and it would be dishonorable for him to revoke it;
but when he understood that these people were so prized by her
(as in truth these are to me) you may see what he did for her.
Therefore I leave these lines with you,
appealing to the faithful and true witness of God, which is one in all consciences,
before whom we must all appear, with whom I shall eternally rest,
in everlasting joy and peace, whether you will hear or forbear: with him is my reward,
with whom to live is my joy, and to die is my gain,
though I had not had your forty-eight hours`' warning,
for the preparation to the death of Mary Dyer.

And know this also, that if through the enmity,
you shall declare yourself worse than Ahasuerus, and confirm your law,
though it be but the taking away the life of one of us,
that the Lord will overthrow both your law and you by his
righteous judgments and plagues poured justly upon you,
who now, while you are warned thereof, and tenderly sought unto,
may avoid the one by removing the other.

If you neither hear nor obey the Lord nor his servants,
yet will he send more of his servants among you, so that your ends shall be frustrated,
that think to restrain them you call cursed Quakers, from coming among you,
by any thing you can do to them.
Yes, verily, he has a seed here among you, from whom we have suffered all this while,
and yet suffer,
whom the Lord of the harvest will send forth more laborers
to gather out of the mouths of the devourers of all sorts,
into his fold, where he will lead them into fresh pastures,
even the paths of righteousness, for his name`'s sake.
Oh! let none of you put this day far from you, which, verily, in the light of the Lord,
I see approaching, even to many in and about Boston,
which is the bitterest and darkest professing place,
and so to continue so long as you have done, that ever I heard of.
Let the time past therefore suffice for such a profession
as brings forth such fruits as these laws are.

In love and in the spirit of meekness, I again beseech you,
for I have no enmity to the persons of any;
but you shall know that God will not be mocked, but what you sow,
that shall you reap from him,
that will render to every one according to the deeds done in the body,
whether good or evil; even so be it, says Mary Dyer.

WILLIAM LEDDRA, an inhabitant of the island of Barbados,
who came also into the jurisdiction of bloody Boston in New England,
to visit his friends who lay under great sufferings in prison,
was himself cast into prison, and locked in chains, with a log of wood tied to him,
lying down and rising up with the same, during a miserably cold winter,
in an open prison, till the First month, 1661,
when he was brought to the court at Boston with his chains and log at his heels.
The court told him that he was found guilty, and was to die.

[.discourse-part]
William Leddra asked what evil he had done.

[.discourse-part]
The court replied that his own confession was as good as a thousand witnesses.

[.discourse-part]
_William Leddra:_ What was that?

[.discourse-part]
The court answered, that he had owned, that those who were put to death, namely,
William Robinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, and Mary Dyer, were innocent +++[+++of that]
for which they died; and that he would not put off his hat in court,
and that he would say thee and thou to the magistrates.

[.discourse-part]
_William Leddra:_ Then you put me to death for speaking English,
and for not putting off my clothes.

[.small-break]
'''

After some more words they pronounced sentence of death upon him,
and on the 14th of the First month, 1661, they knocked off his chains,
and he took his leave of his fellow-prisoners in most tender love,
led as a sheep to the slaughter, in the meekness of the spirit of Jesus,
resigned up in the will of God to seal the truth of the testimony he had borne,
with his blood.
Being encompassed with the guards, and as he was about to ascend the ladder, he said,
'`All that will be Christ`'s disciples must take up the cross.`'
And standing where the guards ordered him,
with an exceedingly fresh living countenance he spoke to the people, and said,
'`For bearing my testimony for the Lord against deceit, and the deceived,
am I brought here to suffer:`' which much affected the people.
And as the executioner was putting the halter about his neck,
in the meekness and sense of Christ Jesus he said, '`I commit my cause to you, O God.`'
And just at turning off the ladder he called out, '`Lord Jesus receive my spirit.`'

An Epistle of William Leddra, to Friends,
written by him the day before he was put to death.

[.salutation]
To the society of the little flock of Christ, grace and peace be multiplied.

Most dear and inwardly beloved!
The sweet influences of the morning star, like a flood,
distilling into my innocent habitation,
have so filled me with the joy of the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
that my spirit is as if it did not inhabit a tabernacle of clay,
but is wholly swallowed up in the bosom of eternity, from which it had its being.

Alas!
Alas!
What can the wrath and spirit of man that lusts to envy,
aggravated by the heat and strength of the king of the locusts,
which came out of the pit, do unto one that is hid in the secret places of the Almighty?
Or unto them that are gathered under the healing wings of the prince of peace?
Under his armor of light they shall be able to stand in the day of trial,
having on the breast-plate of righteousness, and the sword of the spirit,
which is their weapon of war against spiritual wickedness, principalities and powers,
and the rulers of the darkness of this world, both within and without.`'

O my beloved, I have waited like a dove at the windows of the ark,
and have stood still in that watch, which the Master, without whom I could do nothing,
did at his coming reward with the fulness of his love, wherein my heart did rejoice,
that I might in the love and life of God speak a few words to you,
sealed with the spirit of promise,
that the taste thereof might be a savor of life to your life,
and a testimony in you of my innocent death.
And if I had been altogether silent, and the Lord had not opened my mouth unto you,
yet he would have opened your hearts,
and there have sealed my innocence with the streams of life,
by which we are all baptized into that body which is of God,
with whom and in whose presence there is life, in which, as you abide,
you stand upon the pillar and ground of truth.
For the life being the truth and the way, go not one step without it,
lest you should compass a mountain in the wilderness;
for unto everything there is a season.

As the flowing of the ocean does fill every creek and branch thereof,
and then retires again towards its own being and fulness, and leaves a savor behind it,
so does the life and virtue of God flow into every one of your hearts,
whom he has made partakers of his divine nature; and when it withdraws but a little,
it leaves a sweet savor behind it, that many can say,
they are made clean through the word that he has spoken to them;
in which innocent condition you may see what you are in the presence of God,
and what you are without him.

Therefore, my dear hearts, let the enjoyment of the life alone be your hope,
your joy and consolation,
and let the man of God flee those things that would lead the mind out of the cross,
for then the savor of life will be buried.
And though some may speak of things that they received in the life, as experiences,
yet the life being veiled,
and the savor that it left behind being washed away by the fresh flood of temptation,
the condition that they did enjoy in the life, boasted of by the airy mind,
will be like the manna that was gathered yesterday, without any good scent or savor.
For it was only well with the man while he was in the life of innocency,
but being driven from the presence of the Lord into the earth, what can he boast of?

Although you know these things, and many of you much more than I can say,
yet for the love and zeal I bear to the truth and honor of God,
and tender desire of my soul to those that are young,
that they may read me in that from which I write,
to strengthen them against the wiles of the subtle serpent that beguiled Eve; I say,
stand in the watch within, in the fear of the Lord, which is the very entrance of wisdom,
and the state wherein you are ready to receive the secrets of the Lord.
Hunger and thirst patiently, be not weary, neither doubt.
Stand still, and cease from your own working,
and in due time you shall enter into the rest, and your eyes shall behold his salvation,
whose testimonies are sure, and righteous altogether.
Let them be as a seal upon your arm, and as jewels about your neck,
that others may see what the Lord has done for your souls.
Confess him before men, yes, before his greatest enemies;
fear not what they can do unto you: greater is he that is in you,
than he that is in the world.
He will clothe you with humility, and in the power of his meekness,
you shall reign over all the rage of your enemies in the favor of God, wherein,
as you stand in faith, you are the salt of the earth; for many seeing your good works,
may glorify God in the day of their visitation.

Take heed of receiving that which you see not in the light,
lest you give ear to the enemy.
Bring all things to the light, that they may be proved whether they are wrought in God.
The love of the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye,
are without the light, in the world.
Therefore possess your vessels in all sanctification and honor,
and let your eye look at the mark.
He that has called you is holy: and if there be an eye that offends, pluck it out,
and cast it from you.
Let not a temptation take hold, for if you do, it will keep you from the favor of God,
and that will be a sad state; for without grace possessed,
there is no assurance of salvation.
By grace you are saved, and the witnessing of it is sufficient for you,
to which I commend you all, my dear friends, and in it remain your brother,

THOMAS FORSTER, of London, was convinced about the year 1658,
and thereupon forsook much of this world`'s gain and preferment for the sake of Christ,
(he then belonging to the civil law) and was in his life-time
freely given up to serve the Lord with body,
soul and whole substance, that he might run the race and keep the truth;
which made him willing to deny himself, and take up the daily cross for Christ`'s sake,
that he might be truly wise.
He foresaw, several years before it happened,
that the city of London should be destroyed; and his wife and family, at his admonition,
removed into the out parts,
and by that means escaped the judgment which afterwards came to pass upon the city,
when it was burned by fire in the year 1666.
He also foretold the sufferings which God`'s people have since been tried with, saying,
'`The holy city will be besieged; but blessed are they who keep in the faith,
for the time of deliverance will assuredly come,`' etc.
And a little before his departure out of this world, he said, '`Ah! friends,
abide in God`'s pure holy truth all the day long,
and you shall see the rising of his glory.`'
So he finished his course, and fell asleep, in the year 1660.

RICHARD HUBBERTHORN was born in the north part of Lancashire;
his father was a yeoman of the county, and of good repute.
Richard was his only son, inclinable from his youth to religion, fearing the Lord,
and was faithful in all things according to the light and knowledge received.
His natural disposition was meek and lowly, and he loved peace among men,
and he sometimes preached among his sober and sincere companions.

When it pleased God to raise up his people in the north parts of England,
this same person was one among the first whose heart
the Lord touched with the sense of his power,
and he went through great afflictions,
through the dispensation of the grace and spirit of Christ Jesus,
until such time as the same power that killed did make alive; it wounded,
and also healed.
Being raised up by the holy spirit of the Lord,
he was made a minister of the everlasting gospel,
and accordingly went forth in the name and power of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and travelled to and fro in the nation for the space of nine years;
and thousands were as seals to the power and verity of his ministry,
and of his faithfulness among the churches of Christ.

He was a man of small stature, of a weak constitution of body, and though slow of speech,
yet he was very wise, and knew his season when to speak, and when to be silent.
When he spoke, it was with such discretion and plainness of words,
that reached perfectly the matter intended; and his speech being with grace,
and his ministry savory, God made him and his service a blessing to many.
He was not easily moved into grief by adversity, or into joy by prosperity;
a faithful contender for the living faith once delivered to the saints,
which stands in the power of God, and works by love.

He was, with many others of the people called Quakers,
taken from the Bull and Mouth meetinghouse in London, and had before Sir Richard Brown,
who with his own hands did violence to him, and then committed him to Newgate,
where being thronged up in a nasty prison, he was taken sick,
and in a few days grew weaker and weaker.

About two days before his decease, some of his dearest friends visiting him,
asked if any thing was on his mind; his answer was,
that there was no need to dispute matters, he knew the ground of his salvation,
and was satisfied forever in his peace with the Lord; and we know, said he,
one another well, and what each of us can say about these things.
During his sickness he expressed much love to friends;
and his mind was redeemed out of all visible things; and several times he would say,
'`The word of the Lord is with me.`'
And farther, '`That faith which has wrought my salvation I well know,
and have grounded satisfaction in it.`'

In the time of his sickness, he was kept feeding in retiredness within,
so that one might feel his strength in the Spirit, that kept him so still,
that it was not remembered that he groaned all the time of his sickness.
On the seventh day in the morning he asked for the mistress of the house, and said,
'`This night, or tomorrow, I shall depart hence.`'
The next morning he said to one sitting by him, '`Do not seek to hold me,
for it is too strait for me; and out of this straitness I must go,
for I am wound into largeness, and am to be lifted up on high, far above all.`'
So in the evening, being the first day of the week, and the 17th of the Sixth month,
1662, he finished his course, according to his own words,
and was gathered up to his Father.
He wrote many treatises, which are collected together in print.

EDWARD BURROUGH, born in the county of Westmoreland, about the year 1635,
of honest parents, was in his childhood ripe in knowledge,
and did far excel many of his years.
Grey hairs were upon him when but a youth,
and he was inclinable to the best things and the
nearest way of worship according to the scriptures,
accompanying the best men.
His natural disposition was bold and manly, dexterous and fervent,
and what he took in hand, he did with his might.
Loving, courteous, merciful, and easy to be entreated; he delighted in conference,
and reading of the holy scriptures.

When it pleased God to visit his people in the north of England,
this servant of Christ was early called, in the year 1652,
when about seventeen years of age.
He was sent forth by the Spirit of the Lord to preach the everlasting gospel, repentance,
conversion, salvation, and remission of sins,
in the name and power of the Lord Jesus Christ, the savior of mankind;
and was an able minister of the glad tidings of salvation.
In most parts of England, and through Ireland several times,
and in Scotland and Flanders, his ministry was made effectual by the mighty power of God,
in turning many thousands from darkness to light; for as he began early,
so he labored much in the heat of the day, breaking up rough places, and untilled ground,
and often walked as it were among briars and thorns, which scratched, pricked,
and tore with great opposition.
But he broke through them all, not regarding the opposition,
and the sufferings that he met with, for the good of souls.

His industry in the Lord`'s work was very great, he seldom having many hours repose,
making the Lord`'s work his whole business,
not taking so much liberty as to spend one week to himself, about any outward occasion,
in ten years; and it was his grief if any opportunity was missed in doing good.
He was a man of no great learning, which men so much admire,
yet he had the tongue of the learned,
having had experience of the work of God in many conditions,
so that he could speak a word, in due season,
to the understandings and consciences of all men with whom he had converse,
for his words administered grace to the hearer.

At the age of nineteen, in the year 1654, he came up to London,
and was one of the first who preached in that city,
and great opposition he met with there;
but God made his ministry effectual to the conversion of hundreds.
He continued about London very much, at times, between eight and nine years,
speaking of the things of the kingdom of God.
His heart was much drawn towards London, and he often said,
when sufferings came for the gospel`'s sake, '`I can freely go to that city,
(i. e. London,) and lay down my life for a testimony of that truth
which I have declared through the power and spirit of God.`'

In the year 1662, visiting friends in the city of Bristol, he took his leave,
and said to many, '`I am going up to the city of London,
to suffer among friends in that place.`'
A little after his return to the said city,
he was taken from a meeting of the people called Quakers,
at the Bull and Mouth meetinghouse, by soldiers under the command of Sir Richard Brown,
mayor, and committed to Newgate by the said mayor, not for evil doing,
but for testifying to the name of the Lord Jesus, and for the worship of God.
There he lay in prison with six or seven score friends more, upon the same account,
many of them being shut up among felons in nasty places;
and for lack of prison-room they grew weak, sickened, and died,
among whom this young man was one; his sickness increasing upon him daily,
though in much patience he was carried through all.

He was in prayer often, both day and night, saying at one time,
'`I have had a testimony of the Lord`'s love to me from my youth,
and my heart has been given up to do his will.
I have preached the gospel freely in this city,
and have often given up my life for the gospel`'s sake.
Lord, rip open my heart, and see if it be not right before you.`'
Another time he said, '`There lies no iniquity at my door;
but the presence of the Lord is with me, and his life I feel justifies me.`'
Afterwards he said to the Lord, '`You have loved me when I was in the womb,
and I have loved you from my cradle, and from no youth unto this day,
and have served you faithfully in my generation.`'

He spoke to friends that were about him to live in love and peace, and love one another;
and said, '`The Lord takes the righteous from the evil to come:`'
and prayed for his enemies and persecutors, and said, '`Lord,
forgive Richard Brown who imprisoned me.`'
Again he said, '`Though this body of clay must turn to dust, yet I have this testimony,
that I have served God in my generation; and that spirit which has lived, and acted,
and ruled in me, shall yet break forth in thousands.`'
In the morning before he departed, being sensible of his death, he said,
'`Now my soul and spirit is centered in its own being with God,
and this form of person must return from where it was taken.`'
And after a little season, he gave up the ghost, as a martyr for the word of God,
and testimony of Jesus.

He was born in 1635, began to preach 1652, and died 1662,
of whose written labors there is a volume printed,
containing almost nine hundred pages in folio.

HUMPHREY SMITH, of Little Cowrne, in the county of Hereford, formerly a public preacher,
was convinced of truth about the year 1655,
and came to be an able minister of the gospel of Christ, which he freely preached,
and turned many to righteousness,
and gave forth many warnings and exhortations to the people,
as may be seen at large in the printed collection of his works.
The Lord showed him in a vision, in the fifth month, 1660,
the destruction of the city of London by fire,
which was six years before it came to pass; and which vision he published before-hand,
as a warning to the people to repent; part whereof is as follows:

[.embedded-content-document.paper]

[.blurb]
=== Part of the vision of Humphrey Smith, which he saw concerning the burning of the city of London, in the fifth month, 1660, which was three years before his decease, and six years before it was fulfilled.

As for the city herself, and her suburbs, and all that belonged to her +++[+++I beheld]
a fire was kindled therein, but she knew not how, even in her goodly palaces,
and the kindling of it was in the foundation of her buildings.
There was none could quench it, neither was there any able;
and the burning thereof was exceedingly great, and burned inward in a hidden manner,
which cannot be expressed.
The fire consumed foundations which the city stood upon, and the tall buildings fell,
and it consumed all the lofty things therein,
and the fire searched out all the hidden places, and burned most in secret places,
but the consumption was exceedingly great wherewith it was consumed.

And as I passed through her streets, I beheld her state to be very miserable,
and very few were those that were left in her, who were but here and there one,
and they feared not the fire, neither did the burnings hurt them;
but they were (and walked) as mournful people, and the fire burned everywhere,
so that there was no escaping of it.
And thus she became a desolation, and as an astonishment;
for the burning was allowed of God for her chastisement,
and could not be quenched nor overcome.
There was none could stop the flaming; and the fire consumed all things,
both stone and timber; and burned under all things, and under all foundations;
and that which was lifted up above it fell down, and the fire consumed it.
The flaming continued, though the foundation was burnt up,
and all the lofty part brought down by the fire; yet there was much old stuff,
and part of broken desolate walls and buildings in the midst,
which the fire continued burning against; and that which was taken, as to make use of,
which yet escaped the fire, became useless in men`'s hands, as a thing of naught.
And the vision thereof remained in me, as a thing that was secretly showed me of the Lord.

And now let her wise men find out the matter, and her prudent men read, and her divines,
so called, interpret the vision, and let every one look to their own ways.

--

This, with much more that Humphrey Smith saw, was printed and published in the year 1660,
as a warning whereby people might stand in the day of trial,
and endure the hour of trouble.
See it at large in his printed vision in the year 1660.

Besides other things which the Lord revealed to him,
he had also a clear sight of his own sufferings, and death thereby.
For about the year 1662, traveling among friends about London,
he told some of them that he had a narrow path to pass through; and said several times,
before he was taken up, he saw he should be imprisoned,
and that it might cost him his life.
Taking leave of his friends, he set forward, in the will of God, westward;
and being in a meeting of the people called Quakers, at Alton in Hampshire,
he was taken from there, and had before the two lieutenants of the county,
who committed him to the stinking close prison of Winchester, where,
after a whole year`'s imprisonment, he fell sick.

In the time of his sickness he spoke many precious words to friends about him,
signifying that he was given up to the will of God, either in life or death.
And as he lay under great illness, he said,
'`My heart is filled with the power of God;`' and, '`It is good for a man,
at such a time as this, to have the Lord to be his friend.`'
Another time he said, '`Lord, you have sent me forth to do your will,
and I have been faithful unto you in my small measure, which you have committed unto me;
but if you will yet try me further, your will be done.`'
Also he said, '`I am the Lord`'s; let him do what he will.`'
And near the time of his departure, he prayed earnestly, saying, '`O Lord,
hear the inward sighs and groans of your oppressed,
and deliver my soul from the oppressor: hear me, O Lord, uphold and preserve me.
I know that my Redeemer lives: you are strong and mighty, O Lord.`'
He prayed that the Lord would deliver his people from their cruel oppressors;
and for those who had been convinced by him, that the Lord would be their teacher.

He lay quiet and still, sensible to the last moment, and died a prisoner for the truth,
in the common jail of Winchester, on the 4th of the Eighth month, in the year 1663.

JOHN AUDLAND was born in the county of Westmoreland, near Cam`'s-gill, and when a child,
he was ripe and quick of understanding.
About the eighteenth year of his age, the Lord inclined his heart towards himself,
and he delighted in reading the scriptures; and having a large knowledge and memory,
could discourse of things relating to religion, and became an eminent preacher,
not only among the most strict sort of professors, but sometimes also at chapels,
and public parishplaces of worship,
where great multitudes of people would flock after him.

About the twentieth year of his age he married Anne Newby, of Kendal,
belonging to the same religious meeting, afterwards the wife of Thomas Camm,
of Cam`'s-gill in Westmoreland.
This John Audland was one of those before mentioned,
who was convinced the first time that he heard George Fox at Firbank chapel,
and received him into his house.
Seeing the emptiness of his own high-flown notions and profession in religion,
he sat down in silence and astonishment, like Job, for many days;
and great was the work of the Lord upon him, being stripped of his earthly wisdom,
and in that state he mourned and wept bitterly, for he saw where he had been,
and that it was the Lord alone that could help him.

In great compassion the Lord revealed his saving health and arm of power,
by which he raised him up,
and filled him with wisdom and strength for the performance of that work +++[+++in which]
he would concern him, in gathering home the outcasts of Israel,
and the dispersed of Jacob; and sent him forth to preach redemption,
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the poor, and deliverance to the captive,
and the day of vengeance upon the wicked.
Leaving all his outward concerns; he went forth, and the dread, wisdom,
and majesty of the Lord was with him,
and many hundreds were turned to the Lord through him, as an instrument in God`'s hand.
Bristol, and several counties in the west of England,
were witnesses of the power and efficacy of his ministry, who with John Camm,
was of the first of those called Quakers who went to that city,
preaching Christ Jesus the light of the world.
He was often concerned in disputations, and the Lord furnished him with matter,
so that he stopped the mouths of gainsayers; his testimony was large and free,
affecting almost to all sorts of people, and he had a word in season to all conditions;
but notwithstanding he was young and strong,
yet that service much spent him several years before he died.

He had been several times in prison for his testimony`'s sake, as at Newcastle,
and at Bristol; and often in great perils, sore beatings, and cruel mockings,
both of the rabble, and also of the bitter spirited professors, but through all,
the Lord preserved him faithful.
He growing weak by a lingering distemper of a cough and consumption,
would often say in his sickness, '`Ah! those great meetings in the orchard at Bristol,
I may not forget.
I would so gladly have spread my net over all, and have gathered all,
that I forgot myself, never considering the inability of my body.
But it is well, my reward is with me, and I am content to give up and be with the Lord,
for that my soul values above all things.`'

Near his death, friends visiting him,
the Lord did wonderfully open his mouth in exhortation,
to their great refreshment and joy, as if he had been without sense of sickness.
He had a tender regard to his dear wife;`'But in this,`' said he,
'`my will is in true subjection, submitting to the will of the Lord,
whether life or death.`'
He desired his wife to give him up freely to the disposing hand of the Lord;
and the Lord strengthened her freely to recommend him into his hands,
which made him easy.

He was often, in the time of his sickness,
exceedingly filled with the high praises of God,
being overcome in the sense of God`'s love, joy, and everlasting peace.
When he grew weaker, he would be helped up upon his knees,
and upon his bed fervently supplicated the Lord, in the behalf of his whole heritage,
that they might be preserved in the truth, out of the evil of the world;
and that his gospel might spread, and be published,
to the gathering of all that appertain to Israel.
So was he sweetly taken away in the joy of the Lord, on the 22nd of the First month,
in the year 1664.

He was convinced in 1652, and died 1664, being aged about thirty-four years.

RICHARD FARNSWORTH, of Balby, in Yorkshire,
was also one of those whom the Lord raised up early in the work of the ministry.
He suffered about twelve months`' imprisonment at Banbury, in Oxfordshire,
in the year 1655, and many were turned to God by him.
He was mighty in discourses, and disputes with priests and professors,
and after much labor in the work of the ministry, and great sufferings and persecutions,
he at last finished his testimony in London.

A little space before his departure out of this life, sitting up in his bed,
he spoke in as much power and strength of spirit
as he had ever done at any time in his health,
these words following: '`Friends, God has been mightily with me,
and has stood by me at this time,
and his power and presence have encompassed me all along.
God has appeared for the owning of my testimony, and has broken in upon me as a flood,
and I am filled with his love more than I am able to express;
and God has really appeared for us.
If God himself had come down, and spoken as a man,
he could not have spoken more clearly to us than he has done,
by the many testimonies from heaven in his people.
Therefore I beseech you, friends, here of this city of London, whether I live or die,
be faithful to your testimony God has committed to you.`'

He died in the city of London, in the year 1666.

MARY HARRIS, of London, a maid young and beautiful,
went often with her relations to the meetings of the people called Quakers,
and had a love raised in her to the blessed truth,
and to them who held it in a pure conscience;
yet still lived in the customs and fashions of this evil world.
But the same love of God that had begotten tenderness in her heart, and love to truth,
followed her, and would not allow her to sit down in the world without trouble.
The Lord visited her with great weakness, so that she grew ill,
and fell into a consumption for about three years;
and being often visited by Josiah Coale, and put in mind to consider,
whether the hand of the Lord was not upon her for her unfaithfulness and disobedience,
she did consider the matter, and the Lord set it home upon her heart,
and she cried to him for mercy; and applied her heart to the Lord,
and his faithful messengers, saying, '`I have hardened my heart at many precious meetings,
when the Lord has smitten me; and I have seen plainly,
that the Lord would have gathered me; but I said in my heart, if I receive this,
if I give up to this, I must be a Quaker, and I cannot be a Quaker.
Then would I take my heart from attending upon the ministration of truth,
and then my heart became more hard.
'`What shall I do,`' said she,
'`that now I may receive the faithful sayings of the servants of the Lord?
Oh! that my heart were open; but it is shut and hard:
when shall I find mercy in this state?`'

She remained so for some time, and grew weaker and weaker in body;
and on the first day she took her bed she was much
under the righteous judgments of the Lord,
and felt his word in her heart as fire.
But the Lord in judgment remembered mercy, and having brought her very low,
he showed her the child`'s state, which she with great delight desired;
and indeed she became as a little child, fit for the kingdom of heaven.
Then did the Lord rend the veil, and showed her his glory,
and the preciousness of his pure truth, and the light shined out of darkness,
and in it she saw light, and received the knowledge of God;
and her heart was filled with joy and praises to the Lord, saying, '`I am well;
I feel no pain.
I am full; my cup runs over.
I am filled as it were with marrow and fatness.
I have seen his glory, and tasted his precious truth.
How pure is God`'s everlasting truth?
Nothing so pure; and they who indeed receive it, are made pure by it.
Praised be the Lord who has made me partaker of it, and placed me among his people.
Oh! blessed God, who has given me cause to sing aloud of your praise.`'
Many precious words she spoke to several persons who came to visit her,
to their several conditions, showing to some, who lived in pleasure, her hands, saying,
'`See here, the Lord has made these bones bare for my rebellion;
because I would not submit to his precious truth.
He has brought me to the dust, and I must lay down this body as a sacrifice.
Oh! do not you stand out, it will cost you dear, if ever you find mercy.`'
Then she would sing praises to the Lord, and exhorted all speedily to embrace truth,
and warned others professing truth, from following the fashions of the world,
crying to the Lord to wash her thoroughly.
Some would say to her, '`It may be you may recover.`'
'`No, no,`' she replied, '`I must lay down this body for my rebellion.
In my vain life, if any had said I should recover,
it would for a little time seem to refresh me;
and if they had said surely I could not live long, it would cast me down;
but now I long for death.
I must lay down this body; '`for,`' said she, '`when I received God`'s everlasting truth,
I received the sentence of death:`' and this she was positive in all along.

More sensible expressions she uttered, which I omit for brevity.
About half an hour before her departure, she was taken with a very great trembling,
and seemed to be somewhat troubled; when one near her said, '`What is the matter?
are you in any doubt concerning the truth of which you are made partaker?`'
She replied, '`No, no; that is God`'s pure everlasting truth, which the people of God,
called Quakers, are made partakers of, and for which they suffer; that is everlasting,
that is the true spirit, and their God is my God;
and although I see it not now as I have seen it, yet I bring in my testimony,
that is the truth that shall abide forever; that is pure,
and nothing that is defiled shall be sheltered under it.
That is the truth which enlightens every man coming into the world:
the little seed in me is become great, great, great!
Blessed be God who has placed me among his people, and I possess what they possess;
and when the faithful die as I die, my portion will be their portion; and my cup is full,
it runs over and over.`'
Then she breathed a little thicker for about the space of a quarter of an hour;
and so without groan or sigh, or the least motion, she shut her eyes and slept.
Glory to God forever.

She died at the widow Mary Forster`'s, in that called St. John`'s street, near Smithfield,
London, in the year 1668

JOSIAH COALE, born of a family of good repute among men, near the city of Bristol,
was convinced of God`'s everlasting truth,
through the powerful ministry of that servant of God, John Audland, about the year 1655.
The word of life pierced Josiah to the heart,
and wrought effectually to his salvation and redemption.
He walked for a time under deep judgment, and mournfully,
so that he became a gazing stock and wonder to his former acquaintance.
But God`'s arm was strong, and plucked up every evil plant, and purified him,
and made him fit for the Lord`'s use,
and an able minister of the everlasting gospel of Christ Jesus; an incessant laborer,
few more spent in God`'s service.
His soul seemed wholly bent to the renowning the name of Christ;
and the enemies of truth he ever accounted his enemies.

His declaration was to the ungodly like an axe, or hammer,
and a sword sharp and piercing,
being mostly attended with an eminent appearance of the dreadful power of the Lord,
to the cutting down many tall cedars, and making the strong oaks to bow;
but to the faithful and diligent, who minded the things of Christ more than their own,
oh! how soft and pleasant were the streams of immortal life that ran through him,
to the refreshing of those!
It was his life and joy to be speaking the word of the Lord, and not his own words;
and many thousands were living witnesses to the power,
virtue and efficacy of his ministry; but above all,
he was terrible to the sowers of strife, secret backbiters,
and such as rend the holy body, and separated from the life, love,
and fellowship of the blessed truth; who, in their own selfish spirits,
set themselves over their brethren, by feignedness and deceitful appearances,
to the destroying the simple-hearted.

In his conversation, his kindness was so mixed with seriousness,
and his familiarity with a stayed and exemplary behavior,
that he was an honor to the truth,
and therein a confirmer of his holy testimony and weaker brethren.

He was hardy, valiant, and fixed; not of those who shun the cross,
or sell their birth-right for a mess of pottage.
He baulked no danger for the sake of his blessed testimony,
which he bore faithfully in England, Holland, the Low Countries, and Barbados;
and had also sore travels among the heathen in America, as in Maryland, Virginia,
and New England, preaching the gospel of Christ among them.
He travelled on foot through the wilderness, from Virginia to New England,
in danger of wild beasts and venomous creatures, +++[+++enduring]
much hunger and cold, and weariness, and through bogs and waters,
often obliged to eat chestnuts for food when hungry,
as appears at large in the record of New England`'s persecution.

He was a good example, as well for his liberality as faithfulness;
for as the prosperity of God`'s truth was above all things most in his eye,
so he was always cautious of making the gospel chargeable to any; for,
having some estate of his own, he freely employed it in the Lord`'s service,
counting nothing too dear for the name and service of the Lord.

Thus having labored his natural strength away in this heavenly warfare,
for the promotion of the glorious truth of the Lord,
and for the advancement of its interest and dominion in the world,
for above twelve years together, he did, with perfect understanding,
and in an extraordinary enjoyment of the Lord`'s life, majesty, and presence,
to the refreshment of the beholders, cheerfully lay down his mortal body.

George Fox, visiting him upon his sick-bed,
queried whether he had any thing upon his mind to write to friends in England,
or beyond sea.
He said that he was clear of writing to them;
and that as the Lord by his power had carried him through England and other nations,
so he had nothing to write; but he desired his love to all friends.
One thing, he said, did lie upon him,
in that he understood Lodowick Muggleton (a most blasphemous
ranter) and his company would boast against him;
and understanding George Fox was preparing a book in answer to the said Muggleton,
desired he might put in a few words as his last testimony against Muggleton;
which George Fox desired him to prepare, and he would call for it as he came back.
He spoke them forth in the power of the Lord, as fresh as if he had ailed nothing,
and a friend took it in writing, which is as follows:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

Forasmuch as I have been informed,
that Lodowick Muggleton has vaunted concerning my departure out of the body,
because of his pretended sentence of damnation given against me;
I am moved to leave this testimony concerning him, behind me:
That he is a son of darkness, and a coworker with the prince of the bottomless pit,
in which his inheritance shall be forever.
The judgment that I then declared against him, stands sealed by the Spirit of the Lord,
by which I then declared unto him,
That in the name of that God that spans the heavens with his span,
and measures the waters in the hollow of his hand, I bind you here on earth,
and you are bound in heaven; and in the chain under darkness,
to the judgment of the great day you shall be reserved;
and your faith and strength you boasted of I defy and trample under foot.
I do hereby further declare the said Lodowick Muggleton to be a false prophet,
in what he said to me at that time, namely,
That from henceforth I should always be in fear of damnation,
which should be a sign to me that I was damned; which fear I never was in since;
so that his sign given by himself did not follow his prophecy,
which sufficiently declares him to be a false prophet.

--

George Fox, when he came back again, found Josiah sitting by the fireside,
filled with the power of the Lord, and speaking to friends about him as follows: '`Well,
friends, be faithful to God, and seek nothing for self, or your own glory;
and if any thing wrong arise, judge it down by the power of the Lord God,
that so you may be clear in his sight, and answer his witness in all people;
then will you have the reward of life.
For my part, I have walked in faithfulness with the Lord,
and I have thus far finished my testimony, and have peace with the Lord,
and his majesty is with me, and his crown of life is upon me:
so mind my love to all friends.`'

Then he spoke to Stephen Crisp, saying, '`Dear heart, keep low in the holy fear of God;
that will be your crown.`'
Afterwards he said, '`A minister of Christ must walk as I have walked.`'
Then he desired George Fox to pray, that he might have an easy passage:
and friends seeing him begin to be heavy, desired him to go and lie down on the bed,
which he did; and friends sat about him, and held him,
and he was filled with the power of the Lord and seed of life, which was over all.
So in that he departed away, in the arms of friends, as he sat on the side of his bed,
and had a very easy passage into eternal life.

He died in London, aged thirty-five years and two months, in the year 1668.
He labored in the ministry twelve years, and wrote many treatises,
which are collected together in one volume.

FRANCIS HOWGILL, of Grayridge, in the county of Westmoreland,
an early minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
was convinced of the blessed truth by George Fox,
at that notable meeting at Firbank Chapel, in Westmoreland, in the year 1652.
He soon became a powerful minister, and preached Christ freely as he had received him.
He came to London with Edward Burrough early, to visit that city;
and travelled to Bristol and several parts of the nation,
and suffered imprisonment in Appleby jail, in the year 1652; and a nasty,
stinking prison it was.
He was set at liberty the latter end of the year,
and grew valiant and bold for the name of the Lord, traveling up and down on foot,
preaching the gospel.
He went to the steeple-houses, and to many places,
warning both priests and people of the day of the Lord that was coming upon them,
directing them to Christ Jesus their teacher and Savior.

He came also to London, on foot, with John Camm, to admonish Oliver Cromwell,
soon after he was made protector; and he went with Edward Burrough to Ireland,
and preached Christ under great sufferings there, until he and Edward Burrough aforesaid,
were banished by Henry Cromwell out of Ireland.
Afterwards he was imprisoned in London, in the year 1661,
at the time when the Fifth Monarchy people rose up in arms,
but was clear of that bloody act; and so was set at liberty,
and continued laboring up and down the nation, in the work of the Lord,
and turned many to God.
In the latter end of the Fifth month, in 1663,
he was sent for out of the market in Kendal, by the magistrates,
who tendered him the oath of allegiance,
and because for conscience-sake he could not take it, they sent him to Appleby jail;
and at the assizes, for refusing to take the oath,
sentence of premunire was given against him by the judge, in these words:
'`You are put out of the king`'s protection, and the benefit of the law;
your lands are confiscated to the king during your life,
and your goods and chattles forever; and you to be a prisoner during your life.`'

[.discourse-part]
F+++.+++ Howgill replied, '`A hard sentence for my obedience to the commands of Christ;
the Lord forgive you all.`'

[.discourse-part]
_Judge:_ Well, if you will yet be subject to the laws of the king,
the king will show you mercy.

[.discourse-part]
_Francis Howgill:_ The Lord has showed mercy unto me,
and I have done nothing against the king, or government, or any man, blessed be the Lord,
and herein stands my peace; for it is for Christ`'s sake I suffer,
and not for evil doing.

[.small-break]
'''

The court broke up, and many were sorry to see what was done against him;
but he signified how contented and glad he was,
that he had any thing to lose for the Lord`'s precious truth,
of which he had publicly borne testimony,
and that he was counted worthy to suffer for it.
He was kept a prisoner in Appleby jail four years and a half;
and his body being much spent in his public travels and labors in the gospel,
was not able to endure such close confinement,
though he bore his suffering in much patience and
cheerfulness until the time of his decease.

He was taken ill the 11th of the Eleventh month, 1668,
and though his departure drew nigh, yet was he kept in perfect understanding,
being often very fervent in prayer; and uttered many comfortable expressions,
to the refreshment of those about him.
Two days before his death, his wife and friends being present, he said, '`Friends,
as to matter of words you must not expect much from me,
neither is there any great need of it,
or to speak of matters of faith to you who are satisfied;
only that you remember my dear love to all Friends who enquire of me,
for I ever loved Friends well, and any other in whom truth appeared.
Truly God will own his people, as he has ever hitherto done,
and as we have daily witnessed;
for no sooner had they made that act against us for banishment,
to the great suffering of many good Friends,
but the Lord stirred up enemies against them, even three great nations,
whereby the violence of their hands was taken off.
I say again, God will own his people, even all those that are faithful; and as for me,
I am well, and content to die; I am not afraid at all of death.
Truly one thing was of late in my heart,
and that I intended to have written to George Fox and others,
even that which I have observed, which thing is, that this generation passes away,
when so many good and precious Friends, within these few years have been taken from us;
and therefore Friends had need to watch and be very faithful,
so that we may leave a good, and not a bad savor, to the next succeeding generation;
for you see that it is but a little time that any of us have to stay here.`'

Often he said in the time of his sickness, that he was content to die,
and that he was ready;
and praised God for the many sweet enjoyments and refreshments
he had received on that his prison-house bed where he lay,
freely forgiving all who had a hand in his restraint.
And he said, '`This was the place of my first imprisonment for the truth at this town;
and if it be the place of my laying down the body, I am content.`'

Several persons of note, inhabitants of Appleby, as the mayor and others,
went to visit him some of whom praying God might speak peace to his soul,
he sweetly replied, '`He has done it;`' and they all spoke well of him.
A few hours before his death, some being come to visit him,
he prayed fervently with many heavenly expressions,
that the Lord by his mighty power would preserve
them out of all such things as would spot and defile.
A little after, recovering some strength, he further said,
'`I have sought the way of the Lord from a child, and lived innocently, as among men;
and if any enquire after my latter end, let them know,
that I die in the faith that I lived in and suffered for.`'
These words he spoke, with some other words in prayer,
and sweetly finished his course in much peace with the Lord, in the Eleventh month, 1668.

He labored in the gospel sixteen years:
there is a volume of his works printed in about 740 pages in folio.

THOMAS LOE, of Oxfordshire, was a faithful servant and minister of Christ Jesus,
and converted many to truth, especially in Ireland,
where he travelled through great hardships.
His first going there was about the year 1657; Francis Howgill, Edward Burrough,
and others, having been there before him.
He had an excellent gift, sound and clear in the ministry, powerful in speech,
sharp and quick in his understanding; and many people flocked after him,
and received truth by his ministry in that nation;
and others he confirmed in the truth who were convinced before.
He was often publicly engaged with priests and opposers,
and the Lord made him a sharp instrument in his hand
to confound the adversaries of truth,
and the mouths of gainsayers were stopped.
His company was very desirable, being pleasant and sweet in conversation,
and sympathizing with his friends in affliction,
so that he could speak a word in due season.
He was several times a prisoner for the testimony of truth,
and went out of England several times to visit the nation of Ireland,
in which travels his natural strength was much impaired.
He also labored in the work of the ministry in London, being often there;
and was taken sick in that city,
expressing on his deathbed what exceeding encouragement
and glory he saw and felt of the Lord,
as follows:

'`Glory to you, O God, for your power is known.
God is the Lord.`'
Then speaking to William Penn, whom the Lord had made him instrumental to convince,
he said, '`Dear heart, bear your cross.
Stand faithful for God, and bear your testimony in your day and generation,
and God will give you an eternal crown of glory, that shall not be taken from you.
There is not another way that the holy men of old walked in, and it shall prosper.
God has brought immortality to light, and immortal life is felt: glory, glory,
for he is worthy.
My heart is full, what shall I say?
His love overcomes my heart; my cup runs over, my cup runs over.
Glory, glory to his name forever.
He is come, he has appeared, and will appear.
Friends, keep your testimony for God, live with him, and he will live with you.`'

Another time he said to some friends, '`Be not troubled,
the love of God overcomes my heart.`'
And again he spoke to George Whitehead, and other friends present, saying, '`George,
the Lord is good to me; this day he has covered me with his glory.
I am weak, but I am refreshed to see you: the Lord is good to me.`'
Another friend asked him, '`How are you, Thomas?`'
He answered, '`I am near leaving you, I think; but as well in my spirit as I can desire,
I bless the Lord; and I never saw more of the glory of God than I have done this day.`'
And then being expected to depart, the power of the Lord arose in him,
and he sung to the Lord, '`Glory, glory to you forever.`'
And so continued praising God for some time, which much affected the standers by.

He departed in peace with God, on the 5th of the Eighth month, in the year 1668,
at London.

ELIZABETH FURLY, daughter of John Furly of Colchester, in the county of Essex,
was a child that loved the Lord,
and also those who feared him.. Her delight was to hear truth preached,
and to be with such who excelled in virtue; she feared and hated a lie,
and lived and died in the faith which the people called Quakers profess.
She was taken sick at her father`'s house in Colchester, the 11th of the Twelfth month,
in the year 1669.

Two days before she died, being filled with the love of God,
she uttered many precious sayings concerning the Lord, and his mercies towards her;
praying to the Lord that she might be faithful to the end.
In the presence of several persons she spoke as follows: '`Whatever is not of yourself,
O Lord, purge out of me; yes, purge me thoroughly, leave no wicked word in me,
thrust away the power of darkness.
O Lord, make me able to praise you: let me not come into that way which is evil,
for if I do, I shall dishonor you and your truth.
I hope I shall never rebel against you more, but have full satisfaction in you,
and in your ways, and not in the evil one and his ways.
Wash me, O Lord, thoroughly,
let not an unadvised word come out of my mouth;`' with more to the same purport.
'`Show them, O Lord, the evil of their ways, that have done evilly,
and lay a burden upon their spirits, that they may leave it.
I feel no pain, the Lord is good to me; good is the will of the Lord.
Let your will be done in earth as it is done in heaven.
Everlasting kindness have you shown me,
and I hope I shall never forget it while I am in this world;`'
with more in admiration of the kindness and mercies of God,
and her desire to serve him while she lived.

To one of her brothers she said, '`Improve your time,
for you know not how soon you may be taken away;`'
warning him of the danger of an evil life,
and took him about the neck and kissed him, saying, '`Mind what I say,
O dear brother;`' and with many more words she exhorted him.
She also admonished her other brothers with tender expressions, saying, '`Love the Lord,
brothers, love good men: hate the devil; but oh, love the Lord,
and then you will be a joy to your father and mother.`'
When she saw one of her sisters weep, she said, '`Weep not for me, I am very well.
All serve the Lord, that he may be your portion.
In my Father`'s house there is bread enough, there is fulness, lack of nothing; yes,
there is fulness of bread, durable riches and honor.
I desire never to forget the Lord.`'

As she walked in innocency, so she died in peace, and entered into glory,
the 16th day of the Twelfth month, in the year 1669, aged thirteen years and five weeks.

MARGARET MOLLESON, wife of Gilbert Molleson of the city of Aberdeen in Scotland,
was in her youth an enquirer after the best people,
and joined herself in worship with the most strict
and refined in profession then in that city.
But it having pleased God,
who beheld her hungering desires after himself and his righteousness,
to send some of his faithful witnesses and servants called Quakers,
from the nation of England into the north of Scotland,
who preached the everlasting gospel;
she was one of the first in those parts that received the same.

Coming to taste of the unspeakable love of God, she delighted often to retire therein,
out of the cumbering cares of her family and business.
And although her love to her husband, and cares of her many children, were great,
yet her greatest delight and care was,
to draw nearer and nearer to the true and living God,
the chiefest beloved of her travailing soul.
For that end she often resorted to the public meetings of the people called Quakers,
as well as being frequently in private with the Lord in prayer;
which gave her husband (who was not one called a Quaker) cause to say,
that her knees were worn with kneeling at prayer.

For about four months before her departure hence, he usually found her,
when he awaked in the night-time, in meditation; and after her departure,
he also said before several people coming to visit him,
that he had lost a true Mary and a Martha, none knowing how great his loss was,
and he could not but much lament it.

On the 16th of the Tenth month, 1669, in the morning, she was taken suddenly sick,
and the same day in the evening died,
having been for some time before made sensible of her end; yet her physician,
not supposing that she had been so dangerous, said to her, she needed not fear,
his life for hers; to which she answered, '`Fear, I have no cause;
but you will see you are mistaken.`'
Many relations and neighbors being in her chamber, were in great sorrow;
among whom was a great professor, and an old acquaintance of hers,
who desired those about her to pray for her; which she hearing,
when others thought she had been dying, answered, '`My Advocate is with the Father,
and my peace is made.
I am feeding at a table none of you perceive.`'

Some lamenting much her being like to be taken away from her nine children,
who were all about her bed, she said, '`As many of them as shall truly fear the Lord,
and follow him, shall be provided for:`' which has been since truly fulfilled.
Fixing her eyes on her son Gilbert, who was then about ten years of age,
she said in a heavenly frame of mind, '`Truth is precious, cleave to it.`'
She observing the people in her chamber much lamenting, said to them, '`Settle yourselves,
and be stayed in your minds, for you are now to see the last.`'
Being to reap eternally the fruit of her great and spiritual labors,
she had true cause given her then to declare before those present:
'`Now interruption is to cease,
and my eternal joy is already begun;`' the certain earnest of which she received,
and +++[+++had]
often preferred before all other enjoyments.

Her life and conduct, as well as her latter end,
were such as gained her not only great love and esteem from friends of truth,
but also from others of her acquaintance.
She departed hence on the 16th of the Tenth month, in the year 1669,
about the forty-second year of her age, at Aberdeen, in the kingdom of Scotland.

JANE WHITEHEAD was the wife of Thomas Whitehead, of North Cadbury in Somersetshire.
Her maiden name was Jane Vaugh, and she was born in Westmoreland,
her relations living about Hutton in the same county;
whom she left in obedience to the Lord, and travelled in his service,
and bore witness against the false ways and worships of the world;
and for the sake of her testimony endured much persecution.

In the year 1655, coming to Banbury in Oxfordshire,
to visit her dear friend Anne Audland, then a prisoner for the truth, she,
for bearing witness thereto, and against their cruelty and wickedness,
was also taken and committed to prison, and lay there five weeks.
Not long after, coming again to the said town,
the magistrates tendered her the oath of abjuration;
which she refusing for Christ`'s sake,
who says "`Swear not at all,`" was imprisoned twelve months in a low, wet, nasty place,
in the winter season, that sometimes she would be over shoes in water;
which she endured with much patience.

In the Fourth month, 1662, she was again imprisoned at Banbury,
for worshipping God at a meeting of the people called Quakers,
where she lay in the same nasty prison three months.
These things she suffered before she was married.
Afterwards Thomas Whitehead, aforesaid, took her to be his wife,
by whom she had five children that she left behind her.

At Ivelchester, she endured five months imprisonment, with a young child at her breast,
in a cold winter,
for speaking the words of truth and soberness to the priests of North Cadbury.
But the Lord upheld her by the word of his power,
in the manifold exercises and tribulations which she passed through,
too tedious here to relate.
Those abuses which she endured brought her tender body into weakness,
which attended her several years before she died; and,
under great exercises and weakness of body,
she acknowledged that the Lord was wonderfully good to her.
She often said that the Lord had broken in upon her,
and with his heavenly presence did fill her, to the comfort of her soul: and said,
'`O that the Lord may never take his presence from me.`'
To the last she was kept sensible, and declared that she had the testimony of God`'s love,
and that it would be well with her,
and that she had no desire to live any longer in this world.
She charged her children to be obedient to their father, and that they should mind truth,
and then the blessing of the Lord would be with them.

The morning before she died, being sensible her death was at hand,
she told a Friend that she was going to her long home; and soon after departed this life,
in the love and peace of God, on the 28th day of the Seventh month, in the year 1674.

WILLIAM BAYLEY, who was a Baptist teacher at Poole, was convinced of the blessed truth,
as professed by the people called Quakers, in the year 1655,
and travelled up and down in many places in the service of the Lord.
His gift in the ministry, both as to matter and utterance, was plain and prevalent;
he divided the word aright, for he fed the fat with judgment;
and yet he had milk for babes, and stronger meat for those of riper age.
He was mighty in the holy Scriptures,
being well acquainted both with the history and mystery thereof,
through the assistance of the Holy Spirit, which gave him a true understanding in both.
It was given him, not only to believe and preach the word of faith,
but also to suffer for the same, sometimes by cruel persecutions;
being thrown down and dragged upon the ground by the hair of his head;
and his mouth and jaws endeavored to be rent and broken asunder,
that the ground whereon he lay was smeared with blood.
Yet as if this butchering of him had not been enough to make him a sacrifice,
a heavy gross-bodied persecutor stamped upon his breast with his feet,
endeavoring to beat the breath out of his body;
and when this persecutor had done his pleasure, he commanded the jailor to take him away,
and put him in some nasty hole for his entertainment and cure.

For the maintenance of his family,
he several times adventured his life upon the mighty waters, being master of a ship;
and many beyond the seas were partakers of his labors, and comforted by his ministry.
In his return home from visiting friends in Barbados, he fell sick;
and a little before his departure,
desiring to be remembered to his dear wife and children, he said, '`Well,
shall I lay down my head in peace upon the waters?
God is the God of the whole universe, and though my body sink,
I shall swim a-top of the waters.`'
Remembering his love to Friends in general, and some by name, he immediately sung,
being filled with the power of God,
'`The creating word of the Lord endures forever;`' and spoke to them who sat by,
and took several by the hand, exhorting them to fear God, and not to fear death.
He said, '`Friends at London would have been glad to see my face.
Tell them, I go to my Father and to their Father; to my God, and to their God.
Remember my love to my wife; she will be a sorrowful widow;
but let her not mourn in sorrow, for it is well with me.`'

He then took his leave of the Friends on board, saying, '`I see not one of you,
but wish you all well.`'
A Friend of New England asked him how it was with him: he said, '`I am perfectly well:
and mind my love to Friends in Rhode Island, and New England, and to Friends in Barbados.
I went freely in tender love to them.`'
He uttered more sensible words; and about half an hour past four in the morning,
he departed this life, as if he had gone to sleep, being on 1st day of the Fourth month,
in the year 1675, on board the Samuel of London,
in the latitude of 46 degrees and 36 minutes.

=== Concerning a child about thirteen years old

JOSEPH BRIGGINS, son of William Briggins of Bartholomew Close, in London,
having been a dutiful child to his parents, and ready to receive instruction,
was taken sick the 20th of the fourth month.
Being, as it was thought, very near death; after he had lain silent for about an hour,
he began to appear full of joy and pleasantness, saying, '`I shall praise the Lord,
for he is only to be praised;`' with many more words which they could not remember.
He said, in admiration, '`Oh!
I have never heard of any other God but you, my holy One; I have heard of you,
but now I see you in glory.`'
Calling for his father and mother, he said, '`Father, father, oh! father,
oh! pure and glorious is my Savior who has appeared, and has taken me into his kingdom.
Oh! my eye has seen his glory.`'
Then he prayed, '`You most glorious God,
great and wonderful things are brought to pass by your own pure holy power,
by which you have revealed your Son.
Oh! my King, let all people fear and stand in awe of your power,
by which you have gathered many out of their sinful ways, into pure obedience to you.
You have given us a living knowledge.
Oh! pure, glorious, and holy God, let your life reach unto all my dear friends,
and keep them that know you sure and stedfast upon your holy foundation, Christ Jesus,
my king, whose appearance is very glorious at this day,
and of his government no end is to be, but thousands of thousands, millions of thousands,
shall come to see, and be made partakers of his glorious, bright, shining day.`'

Another time he said, '`There are many ways and baptisms in the world; but oh! you pure,
holy, holy One, we have known your spiritual baptism into Christ Jesus my Lord,
by whom the living water we have known and felt.
Oh! it is indeed exceedingly pure, by which we have been washed from all our sins.
Oh! my King, you were slain, and by the virtue of your pure blood we have this given.
Oh! that all may wait continually upon you,
that they may be kept from all the deceitful ways of the world.`'
To those standing by he said, '`Mind and serve the Lord in your day,
for the holy truth received by you is the way in
which you must wait and obey;`' with much more.
Then he lay silent a little while; but again said,
'`The Lord has taken me into his kingdom,
he has discovered the fresh springs of his love to my soul.
All that know the Lord be obedient to his power,
and he will discover himself more to you, and you shall know more.
Thousands, thousands, millions, shall the Lord call.`'
With more words, after some time of silence.

Some who knew him very well, wondered to hear him speak as he did,
and said they had never heard such words come from him before.
He replied, '`The Lord has fully made known that to my soul,
which I had some feeling of before.`'
The next day he was very earnest in prayer softly to himself,
but the following words were heard: '`Oh! let all that know the pure truth,
come and receive it, says my soul.`'
He also sung of the olive tree, and of the fruit thereof, which he fed on,
and of his refreshment thereby.
He was asked what he meant by the olive tree.
He said, '`The tree of life.`'
Many more sayings he uttered before he departed to his everlasting rest,
which was on the 3rd day of the Fifth month, in the year 1675,
in the thirteenth day of his sickness.

ROBERT JECKEL, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in the county of Northumberland,
having a desire to visit George Fox, who was then at Swarthmore, set out on his journey,
in company with several friends,
but began to be sick the same day that he went from home,
and was ill at several places by the way; but still pressed forward,
and would not be satisfied to stay short of Swarthmore,
where he came the 2nd of the Fifth month, 1676,
and went to bed presently after he came in, and lay sick there nine days.
During his illness, these following words, with many more, were spoken by him:
'`No separation like unto this; soul separated from the body,
the spirit returning to God that gave it, and the body to the earth, from which it came.
Great has the lovingkindness of the Lord been to me, and not to me only,
but to all my dear friends who are faithful unto death.
I have always been faithful to the truth, as to what was manifested;
for God has loved me from a child.`'

He added, spreading out his hands, '`O! the blessed precious truth is above all the world,
and this is my living testimony I have to bear for the Lord, and his truth;
for always I loved truth, and preferred it before all the world; for truth is precious;
and to be valued before all things.
Therefore, oh! my dear friends! prize this precious truth, for it abides forever;
let nothing divert your minds from that service of truth you have,
for as that is kept to, truth answers truth in every heart.
As to the principle of truth, it will reign over all.
Though strange things may happen in this nation,
yet the Lord will crown his blessed truth, and his glory is over all.
Therefore, all my dear friends,
be faithful to that manifestation in your own particulars,
for a profession will stand none in stead,
unless they live in the life and power of truth.`'
Another time he said, '`Though I was persuaded to stay by the way, being indisposed,
before I came to this place, yet this was the place where I would have been,
and the place where I should be, whether I live or die.`'

George Fox visiting him,
exhorted him to offer up his soul and spirit to the
Lord who gives breath and life to all,
and he takes it again; and he lifted up his hands and said, '`The Lord is worthy of it,
and I have done it.`'
George Fox then asked him if he could say, '`Your will, O God, be done on earth,
as it is done in heaven;`' and he lifted up his hands and eyes, and cheerfully said,
he did it.
His mouth was often filled with praises to the Lord, exhorting those about him, saying,
'`Dear friends, dwell in love and unity together, and keep out of jars,
strife and contention, and be sure to continue faithful to the end,
and be not weary in well-doing; for this is a good testimony,
they that continue faithful to the end shall be saved.`'

He said, '`If any bad spirits speak evil of me when I am gone,
you are living witnesses`' (speaking to two friends present,
who were his neighbors)'`that I am an innocent man, and the Lord has cleared me,
and I lay down my head in peace.
As to my wife, I give her freely up to the Lord; for she loves the Lord,
and he will love her.
I have often told my dear wife, as
to what we have in outward things, it was the Lord`'s first before it was ours,
and in that I desire she may serve the truth to the end of her days.
And now, my dear friends, I commit you all to the Lord,
to be preserved and kept in his everlasting power, and bid you all everlastingly, yes,
everlastingly, farewell.
All is done, and to the Lord I leave you all; I commit you all, farewell.`'
Afterwards he said, '`Let us go hence in peace, for I shall go hence,
and be no more seen in mutability.`'

About two hours before he died, George Fox took him by the hand,
and asked him if he was satisfied of his seeing him.
He lifted up his hands, and with a gladness of heart, and smilingly,
praised the Lord and said that his comfort flowed in as a flood.
George Fox asked him what he said; and he spoke those words over again.
And in much patience the Lord did keep him;
and he was in perfect sense and memory all the time of his weakness, often saying,
'`Dear friends give me up, and weep not for me, but be willing to bear a part with me,
for I am content with the Lord`'s doing.`'
He often said that he had no pain; but went away by little and little,
lifting up his hands while he had strength, praising the Lord,
and made a comfortable end, on the 11th of the Fifth month, in the year 1676.

WILLIAM SIXSMITH, of Warrington in the county of Lancaster,
a young man about twenty-one years of age,
was in time of health a pattern of piety and good example.
When he was taken sick, he freely resigned up himself into the hand of the Lord,
refusing a physician, saying,
'`I am satisfied with the Lord`'s love;`' and that he knew his Redeemer lived, who,
if he pleased, was able to restore him to health, and if not, he was content.
In the time of his sickness he was very patient and quiet, often praising God.
A little before his death, calling his father,
with an innocent look he gave him his right hand, saying,
'`I desire you will not be troubled.`'
And so laid down his life in peace, the 24th of the Seventh month, in the year 1677.

FRANCIS PATCHET, of Scotforth, in the county of Lancaster,
was a prisoner for his testimony against tithes:
the priest who prosecuted him removed him up to the Fleet prison in London,
where he died a prisoner.

In the time of his sickness he prayed, '`Lord God everlasting,
glory and honor forever be given to your name.
You have made way for your redeemed as in ancient days,
when you made the sea dry land for your people Israel to go through.
O glory and honor forever be unto your name, who are unchangeable in all your ways.
You made man in your own image, but he lost it through disobedience.
O Lord, in your unspeakable love you sent your only Son Christ Jesus to redeem us again.
Oh! everlasting praises to your name forever;`' with many other words.
Again he said, '`There is no God like our God;
he has given his Son a light into the world, and his salvation to the ends of the earth.
Oh! this blessed day wherein truth has appeared: Oh!
England`'s glory.
Friends, obey the truth, love the truth, buy the truth, and sell it not: Oh!
Christ Jesus, the way, the truth, and the life.`'

Again he said, '`Glorious is the house of God, a house of holiness, a pure house,
a house of love, and her gates praise.
Our God is a consuming fire; he consumes all that is bad, all impurity, all uncleanness,
all that is unholy, all that is wrong.`'
Thus he went on praising God for sending his Son for the redemption of man,
and spoke much of the Lord`'s making a way for his people in the nation of England.
At another time he said, '`My strength fails me.`'
On which, one by him replied, '`I hope the Lord does not fail you:`' he answered,
'`Through mercy the Lord never failed me;`' with more
concerning the Lord`'s building of Zion, etc.
Another time he said, speaking of the Lord, '`Oh! your precious light,
in which I see your glory: what will become of them that despise your light?`'
Again, '`The false prophet and the hireling the Lord will cut down,
and all that resist his blessed work which he has begun in this
nation of England;`' with more words of exhortation to friends,
and praises to God; and so finished his testimony, a prisoner for truth,
the 2nd of the Tenth month, in the year 1677.

CHRISTOPHER BACON, of Polling-hill, in Somersetshire,
was formerly a soldier in the king`'s army.
About the year 1656, some of the Lord`'s servants, called Quakers,
coming into that country to preach the gospel, he went to one of the meetings,
not to receive good, but rather to scoff and deride.
But, through the Lord`'s mercy, he was reached in his conscience,
and received the blessed truth in the love of it;
and afterwards received a dispensation of the gospel of Christ to preach,
and was a diligent laborer in the work of the ministry.
He travelled to London, and into Ireland and Wales,
and many parts of the nation of England, and several were convinced of the truth by him.

In the year 1678, he came into the county of Cornwall, and there fell sick,
being weak of body before, but had a good meeting of Friends in the town.
Upon his sick bed he desired a Friend by him to write comfortably to his wife,
if the Lord should take him away, and advise her,
that she bring up her children in the fear and counsel of the Lord;
and it was his fervent desire that his wife might be kept to truth; and +++[+++likewise]
for all friends.
And said, '`Since it is my lot,
after many great labors and travels for the service of truth,
to come here and lay down my body, I am well satisfied in God`'s will and pleasure,
and am at this time free and clear in my mind, willing to be with God.`'
Then making some pause, he said, '`O! friends, keep in mind your latter end,
and that will make you draw nigh to the Lord, and seek after him.`'

He further said, '`Friends,
take heed that you lose not a heavenly inheritance for an earthly.`'
The day before he died, being the First-day of the week,
he spoke to friends as they were going to meeting, minding his dear love to friends,
and said, '`The Lord`'s presence be among you,
for his presence has attended me in all my labors, travels, sufferings, and exercises,
for his name`'s sake.`'
His end drawing near, and his body weak,
he continued to the last moment in sweet harmony, lifting up his hands,
and in much quietness and peace he gave up the ghost the 29th of the Tenth month,
in the year 1678, aged about fifty-five years.

WILLIAM COALE, of Maryland, in America,
was convinced of the blessed truth about the year 1657,
and was a man of an innocent and tender spirit, of true judgment,
and stood in the power and love of God against unrighteousness and false liberty;
and for true liberty in Christ Jesus, and for holiness, peace, and unity in the church.
He freely and tenderly preached the cross of Christ,
and was living and weighty in his testimony.
He suffered imprisonment in Jamestown prison, in Virginia, with George Wilson,
a Friend of Old England, who travelled into America to preach the gospel,
whom the magistrates of that town persecuted to death,
after they had cruelly beaten and whipped him, and kept him long in iron chains;
and the said William Coale was also much decayed in his body by that cruel imprisonment,
and never recovered it.

His visit to friends in Virginia was very serviceable to many,
some were turned to the Lord through his ministry,
and many were established in the blessed truth.
In the time of his sickness he was cheerful in spirit,
freely given up to the will of God, as a living man prepared to die, saying,
'`The living presence of the Lord is with me;`' with many words more
of the great satisfaction he had from the Lord concerning his peace,
saying, '`I bless the Lord, I have finished my course,
and I have nothing to do but to wait on the Lord to die.`'
So in a short time he departed very peaceably and quietly, about the year 1678.

SARAH BECK, wife of John Beck, of Dockra, in the county of Westmoreland,
was an innocent woman, and one that feared the Lord.
Even from a child, her heart was set to seek him and the prosperity of his truth,
and the welfare of all people; and her chiefest care was to serve and obey the Lord.
Being sick near unto death, it was thought she was dead, but recovering a little,
she said, '`I was well, I was very well, if I had gone.`'
And after that, she praised and magnified the name of God,
which much affected the hearts of many who were with her in her sickness.
She said, '`O Lord, you have satisfied my soul.
I desired that I might praise you, and I am satisfied: honor,
glory and hallelujahs be to you, you God of my life.
I feel sweet peace and great joy: oh! the joy that is laid up for the righteous: oh!
Who would not fear the Lord?
Who would not be faithful?`'

Taking her leave of her husband and her friends, one by one, she said,
with a cheerful countenance, '`I am near going; this sweet end will come;
it makes my heart glad when I remember my end;
it will be the happiest hour that ever came to me.`'
Some observing her to be in great pain and very sick, said one to another,
'`It is very hard;`' she answered, '`No, it is very easy,
for the Lord sweetens it.. Oh! you glorious God, you have satisfied my soul.
I am filled with your pure presence;`' with these words,
'`that I may praise you while I have breath and being!`' as indeed she did,
for even at the very hour of death she said,
'`Call in the family;`' and holding her husband by the hand,
made sweet melody in her heart, saying, '`Dear God,
what shall I render to you for this evening sacrifice?`'
Thus she went on praising God till her natural strength failed,
and then turned her face to the pillow and said no more;
but died as if she had fallen asleep, being the thirteenth of the Sixth month,
in the year 1679.

JOHN MATERN was a German, and educated in the learning of the schools,
intending to be a priest.
But it pleased God to visit him, even in his own country, in the year 1674,
and his wife`'s father, Christopher Proham, who was a priest, was convinced also,
and was a faithful friend, and died in peace with God in England,
where they and their families came to live.

John Matern labored about six years in great integrity,
instructing youth in the knowledge of the tongues,
and endeavored to bring them to the fear of the Lord, and knowledge of his blessed truth.
He lay sick about a week, and about four hours before he departed, at his desire,
they called the youth of the school into his bed-chamber,
where he had a meeting with the family, and he was filled with divine praises,
magnifying the great power of God; and his prayer was fervent,
that the Lord would carry on the good work begun among the children,
and prosper his truth daily everywhere.
He exhorted the children, as they sat around about him,
to be faithful in their measures to a little, and more should be added.
He gave thanks to God for many particular mercies, but more especially,
that he had received the knowledge of the everlasting truth,
and had walked uprightly therein; for which, he declared at that time,
that he had the testimony of a good conscience,
and was entering into eternal rest with the Lord.

He died in rest and peace on the 1st of the Seventh month, in the year 1680.

GILES BARNARDISTON, of Clare, in the county of Suffolk,
came of a family of great account in the world,
and had his education accordingly at the university,
and his natural parts were answerable thereto; but when he received the truth,
he saw not only the emptiness of those things, but of their way of worship also; and,
like Moses, chose rather to join with the poor suffering people of God, called Quakers,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
After he was converted, it pleased God to commit a dispensation of the gospel unto him,
and He laid a necessity upon him to preach the same;
which he faithfully performed to the day of his death,
not regarding the tenderness of his body so much, as to fulfill the will of God.

When he was about to enter upon a hard journey, or otherwise exercised, he would say,
'`That is but for a short time, and we shall have done in this world;
and I desire that I may be faithful to the end,
that I may enjoy that of the hand of the Lord, that I received the truth for.
If it had not been to obtain peace of conscience while I am in this world,
and hopes of everlasting rest with God in the world to come,
I would never have left the glory and pleasure of this world, which I had,
and might have had, a share of, with them that are in it.
Neither would I now leave my house and home, where I have a loving wife,
with all that a man, fearing God, needs to desire, if it was not to obey the Lord,
and to make known his truth unto others, that so they may come to be saved.
For this cause do I forsake father and mother, wife and estate;
and whosoever thinks otherwise of me,
with the rest of my faithful brethren whom God has called into his work,
to declare his name and truth among the sons of men, they are all mistaken of us,
and I would they knew us better.`'
He continued faithful in the Lord`'s work to the end; and he was blessed in his labor,
for he turned many to righteousness.

It pleased the Lord to visit him with sickness, in his return from London to Chelmsford,
and his sickness was short; in which time he gave testimony to the goodness of God,
and said that the Lord was his portion, and that he was freely given up to die,
which was gain to him.
And on the 11th of the Eleventh month; in the year 1680, he departed in peace.

New York, Long Island, Rhode Island, and Barbados; and after many long journeys,
and much service, returned home about the Third month, 1677.

The said Alice, being upon her dying bed,
was asked if she thought she should recover of her sickness; to which she answered,
'`I do not know what the Lord has to do; but I am freely given up to his will,
whether it be life or death; I am as clear as a child.`'
Another time, complaining of the unfaithfulness of some professing truth, she said,
'`But those who are faithful, the Lord will preserve them,
though they may meet with many trials and besetments, both inwardly and outwardly.`'
And again, '`All stand faithful for the Lord in their day,
and none need be afraid of death, for it will be easy to them as it is to me.`'

She often, in the time of her sickness, made melody to God in her heart, and said,
'`Oh! my heavenly Father, how have you filled my cup, and made it to overflow;
for I can do no less than bless and praise your eternal name.`'
She often desired God`'s will might be done, whether it was life or death; '`For,`'

She exhorted friends to be diligent, and to know life and virtue in themselves;
'`For,`' said she, '`the time will come that words shall cease,
and life shall more arise;`' and said, if she lived she must declare it; and if she died,
she must leave it as a testimony for the Lord.
Toward the latter end of the last night she lived, her pain was great,
and she spoke to friends about her, saying, '`Pray to the Lord for me,
that he lay no more upon me than I am able to bear; that I may not offend this good God.`'
And immediately she prayed to the Lord, and had a little ease,
and lay still as if she had been in a slumber, and so grew weaker,

She died in London in the year 1680.

MARY SAMM, daughter of John Samm, of Bedfordshire,
and grand-daughter of William Dewsbury, of Warwick, aged about twelve years,
being taken sick, and her aunt finding her under a concern of mind, asked her,
why she walked so often alone in the garden, when she was well,
for she would many times be weeping alone.
She replied, '`Dear aunt,
I am troubled for lack of a full assurance of my eternal salvation.
Not any knows my exercise but the Lord alone,
what I have gone through since I came to Warwick.
It was begun before I came, but it was but a little.
This was my trouble, I thought I should not live long, and that if I did die,
I did not know where my soul should go;
but I hope the Lord will give me satisfaction before I die.
It is but hope, and though but hope, yet for this my soul shall praise his name forever.`'

The next day, having more assurance of her future happiness,
and some friends coming into her chamber, she said,
'`I have been twice in my days nigh to death,
but the Lord in his tender mercy prolonged my days,
that I might seek his face in the light of Christ,
and come to be acquainted with him before I go hence.`'
Also she said, '`If this distemper do not abate, I must die;
but my soul shall go to eternal joy;
eternal and everlasting life and peace with my God forever.`'
At another time, '`They that live longest, endure the greatest sorrow; therefore, O Lord,
if it be your will, take me to yourself, that my soul may rest in peace with you.`'
With many more good words.

The day following she desired all to go forth of the room.
After a considerable time, her mother and grandfather went in again, when she said,
'`I have now received full satisfaction of my eternal salvation.
It is now done, it is now done.`'
And after saying something to her mother, she said, '`I am very willing to die,
that the Lord may glorify his name this day, in his will being done with me:
often praying to the Lord, to lay no more upon her than she was able to bear, saying,
'`Help me, O my God, that I may praise your holy name forever.`'
Her grandfather advising her to stillness, she answered, '`Dear grandfather, I shall die,
and I cannot but praise the name of the Lord while I have a being.
I do not know how to do to praise him enough.`'
Her grandfather inquiring how she did, she replied, '`I have had no rest to-night,
nor today.
I did not know but I should have died this night, but very hardly I tugged through it;
but I shall die today, and a grave shall be made, and my body put into a hole,
and my soul shall go into heavenly joy, and into everlasting peace forevermore.`'
After more expressions, her aunt asked her if she thought she was upon her deathbed:
she replied, '`Yes, yes, I am upon my deathbed.
I shall die today, and I am very willing to die,
because I know it is better for me to die than to live.`'

After some time, and other expressions, she inquired the time of the day,
which being told, she said, '`I thought it was more.
I will see if I can have a little rest and sleep, before I die.`'
So she lay still, and had a sweet sleep, and awaked without complaint;
and then in a quiet, peaceable frame of spirit laid down her head the same day in peace,
being the 9th of the Second month, in the year 1680, in the twelfth year of her age.

MORDECAI HEARN was a young man whom the Lord in his mercy reached to in his tender years,
and called by his holy Spirit in his heart, and he hearkened to the call of the Lord,
so that he became a prepared vessel, by the Lord, for his use and service.
God opened his heart, and mouth also, sometimes, to declare of his goodness and mercy,
and speak to the praise of his grace in the congregations of his people,
until the twenty-third year of his age, when it pleased the Lord to accept of his mite,
offered in faithfulness and sincerity, and to cut his work short in this evil world,
and give him his heavenly crown of reward.

He was visited with illness, which brought him into a consumption;
and in his weakness and great affliction of body,
he said to some friends who stood by him, as he lay in bed, as follows:
'`Blessed be the Lord,
that ever he made me to remember my Creator in the days of my youth,
seeing old age is not likely to be my portion;
but a portion has the Lord provided for me among the faithful,
in which my soul rejoices with you, dear friends; for this is our joy,
and the crown of our rejoicing.`'
Another time he said, '`Friends, the Lord is wonderfully good to me in my sore affliction;
he comforts me with his sweet presence,
which is more to me than all the fading things of this world.
Oh! it is good to trust in the Lord, for he never fails them that put their trust in him.`'
And so he lay in a sweet, quiet, and tender frame of spirit.

Many friends being about him, he exhorted them, with tears on his cheeks,
to follow the Lord fully, and to go on in his work and service,
and the Lord would be with them.
This he spoke in so living a sense of the Lord`'s power,
that those about him were much broken into tears, which, when he beheld, he,
with a sweet heavenly countenance said, '`Friends, weep not for me; it is well with me.
Death is no terror to me, for the sting thereof is taken away,
so that I am not afraid to die.
And although my body be laid in the dust, yet in this, dear friends,
remember that I am now going but a little before, and you must follow me.`'
And soon after these words were spoken, he raised himself upon his knees, being in bed,
and returned praises to the Lord for his goodness and
lovingkindness that was then shed abroad in their hearts.
He besought the Lord that he would be with his servants and handmaids;
and that he would prosper that work which he had begun.

At another time, a near relation came to visit him, whom he entirely respected and loved,
who had much lost his former condition in the truth,
to whom he spoke in much love and tenderness, saying,
'`Oh! that our portion might be together.
I fear you despair.
Oh! do not distrust the Lord, for he is all sufficient; he is able to restore you:
but I fear you do distrust his mercy.
The thought of it is more grievous to me than all my afflictions.
Oh! that we should be separated; that grieves me.`'

Being full of pain, and weak, he groaned, saying,
'`Surely the Lord will release me in his time; surely the Lord will ease me of this pain,
for I am pained.
I do not desire to live here.`'
When he drew near to his departure, he awaked out of sleep or slumber; and soon after,
his mother discerning him to breathe short, said to his sister,
'`I think your brother is now dying:`' and he, hearing her voice, spoke these words:
'`I am glad, I am glad; I go away with joy.`'
He called for his father, mother, and sister, to kiss them, and said, '`Weep not for me,
for I have peace with the Lord.`'
He lived some hours after, and lay praising him, saying,
'`The Lord is worthy to be waited upon; he will release me in his own time, '`etc.
Speaking to those about him, he said,
'`To outward appearance my time is but short in this world; but this I have to say,
the Lord has been good to me in my pilgrimage,
and therefore be faithful to the Lord in his requirings, to the end of your days,
and he will never leave you nor forsake you.`'

He quietly departed this life, the ninth day of the Seventh month, in the year 1681,
being twenty-three years and ten months old, at Sabridgworth in Hertfordshire.

SARAH CAMM, daughter of Thomas Camm, of Cam`'s-gill, in Westmoreland,
and of Anne his wife, a child of nine years old,
was visited with sickness the 13th of the Seventh month, 1682.
She declared that she should be taken away by death, saying,
'`I am neither afraid nor unwilling to die,
but am freely given up thereto in the will of God.`'
When she saw her relations weep, she would say, '`Oh! do not so, do not so.`'
Being near death, her sickness increased; but she was very patient, only had deep sighs.
Her father asked her if she could not pray to the Lord for help; her answer was,
she could, and did pray.
She further said, it was her belief, that the Lord, the great God of heaven and earth,
would keep her, and preserve her soul, whatever might become of her body.

In the fifth day of her sickness,
being under more than usual exercise of mind and spirit,
after a little space she revived, and sat upright in her bed,
and with a cheerful countenance said as follows, '`My sins are forgiven me,
and I shall have a resting place in heaven.`'
Then looking at her mother, she said, '`Oh! my mother,
there is also a place prepared for you in heaven,
and you shall as certainly enjoy it as any here.
I do not,`' said she, '`desire my mother`'s death, or removal from you;
yet we shall meet in heaven in God`'s time.`'
Seeing her friends weep, she said, '`Oh! you should not do so; I am well, I am well.`'
Her father desired the company to withdraw,
lest they should trouble her but she soon called them in again, and said,
'`Shall I go down to the horrible pit?
No, the Lord has redeemed my soul: and called her brother,
to whom she spoke very sensibly.
To her sister she said, '`Be content, for it is, and will be well with me.
I must go to a more fair place than ever my eyes beheld.
It will be well with me, and all that fear the Lord,
for we shall have everlasting joy in heaven, when the wicked shall be tormented in hell.`'

Seeing her sister weep, she said, '`Do not cry, dear Mary, lest you grieve the Lord:
be subject to the Lord`'s will in all things, and love and be faithful to the truth,
and do not forsake your religion, whatever you suffer for it.`'
And further said, '`I am satisfied with my religion.
I will not forsake it,
though I should be fed with the bread of adversity and water of affliction.
Oh! praises, praises to my God, and my Father.
Our Father, which art in heaven,
hallowed be your name;`' and so said to the end of the Lord`'s prayer twice over;
and the third time till she came to that petition, '`Your will be done on earth,
as it is done in heaven,`' which she spoke deliberately, signifying to those about her,
that they were all to mind that; '`For,`' said she,
'`I am freely given up to his blessed will in all things: praises to my God,
bless his name, O my soul.`'

Another time, her father having her in his arms, she said, '`Oh! my dear father,
you are tender and careful over me, and have taken great pains with me in my sickness,
but it avails not, there is no help nor succor for me in the earth;
it is the Lord that is my health and physician,
and he will give me ease and rest everlasting.`'
Near her end she took leave of the family particularly, saying, with a pleasant voice,
'`Farewell, farewell unto you all, only farewell; signifying,
that now she had no more to say; and so went on praising the Lord,
and continued in a sweet frame till she died, lacking eleven days of nine years old.

She died the 18th of the Seventh month, in the year 1682.

JOSEPH FEATHERSTONE, of Crowland, in Lincolnshire,
was a man whom the Lord endued with much meekness, and he loved truth,
and to do the will of God.
In the time of his sickness he was freely resigned to the will of God,
saying to his wife, '`My dear, give me up to the will of the Lord,
for I can freely give up all.`'
When some of his friends came to visit him, he exhorted them to faithfulness, and said,
'`The Lord will make a dying-bed comfortable to you;`' that
though he felt much sickness and pain upon his body,
yet the refreshment he felt from the Lord made all his troubles easy.

He prayed that his wife and friends might be preserved
in God`'s holy fear and undefiled way,
to bear a testimony to the blessed truth to the end of their days.
The day before he died, being somewhat restless, his wife said, '`Dear heart,
you are restless;`' he answered, with a cheerful countenance,
'`Do you not know where the weary go to rest?`'
and said, '`My rest and fellowship are with the Lord.`'
A little before his death, he rested a pretty while, and being asked how he did, he said,
'`I am well, blessed be the Lord;`' and desired his wife to be satisfied;
and then lifting up his hands, he said, '`O Lord, you are the eternal God.`'
And so fell asleep in the Lord the 26th of the Ninth month, in the year 1682.

JUDITH FELL, a young woman twenty-four years of age, daughter of Thomas and Anne Fell,
near Ireby, in Cumberland, was never inclinable to vain company,
nor to pride nor lightness of carriage, but always was very sober,
and ready to be a good example to others,
so that she abundantly enjoyed the love of the Lord;
insomuch that on her sick-bed she was wonderfully filled, to the refreshment of others.
Her sickness increasing, which was at times very severe upon her,
some inquired of her how she did; she replied, '`I am well every way.
If I should live ever so long, it can never be better; for my heart is fully satisfied,
and my soul magnifies God, who is worthy forever.`'
Another time she requested her father not to desire her health,
for she said she felt that which was beyond all her weakness and sickness.
Another time she said the sting of death was removed,
and she felt victory over the grave; and so praised the Lord, saying, '`Surely it is you,
O God, that lives and reigns, and must reign forever;
and they are ever blessed who serve you, and fear your name.
You, O God, reignest in the hearts of the sanctified, and you have sanctified my heart,
so that I can truly praise your name.
You know, Lord, for what end you have cast me on this bed of sickness;
surely it is for the glory of your name; therefore, Father, glorify yourself in me.`'

The day before she died, she said she saw that that day she was given to her friends;
and so continued quiet and easy in her spirit, and several times slept very sweetly.
At the end of that night her sickness increased, and she desired to see some friends;
and spoke words to their great refreshment.
The next day, after great fits of illness, she broke forth in praises, saying,
'`He is come that brings joy: Oh! the streams of his love run over all,
even to the skirts of the garment.
Now is the fountain set open for Judah and Jerusalem to bathe in.
Once more solace yourself, my soul, and delight yourself in your Savior;
for I feel his love and life run afresh in my soul,
so that now my spirit does magnify him that lives forever.`'
Her distemper prevailing upon her, they thought that she would not have spoken any more;
but she lifted up her head and said, '`This is the way to rest;
this is the way to rest forever.`'
In a little time she drew her last breath, and ended her life comfortably,
in the twenty-fourth year of her age, in the year 1682.

JONAH LAWSON, son of Thomas Lawson, of Westmoreland, aged about fourteen years,
was a youth well inclined, of a peaceable spirit, and not known to tell a lie.
He was taken sick of the small-pox; and in his sickness,
his father putting him in mind of the difference between this world and heaven,
where is nothing but joy, the lad answered, '`Ay, father,
I hope I have but little to answer for, and that I have a good conscience.
I have abhorred lying and swearing, and what I saw to be evil; and am willing to die,
if it be the Lord`'s pleasure, or to live to praise him.`'
His sister weeping, he said to her, '`Weep not, I hope we shall meet in a better place.`'
Soon after he uttered these words to the Lord:
'`The time you have appointed for me on earth; give me grace to praise your name.`'
Presently after, as if answered from heaven, he said, '`O, sweet God.`'
A little before his departure, his father and sister being present, he said,
'`I am coming, I am coming.
I must yield, I must yield.`'

He died on the 23rd of the Twelfth month, in the year 1683, aged fourteen years.
After his death, his father found the following verses of Jonah`'s making, namely:

Humbling yourself, virtue you can not miss.
Delight in virtue; vice be sure to shun:

ELIZABETH BRAITHWAIT, a young maid of seventeen years of age,
died in prison for the testimony of a good conscience, at Kendal, in Westmoreland.
From a child, God by his grace inclined her heart to love, fear, and serve him;
and she was truly obedient to her parents, sober and chaste in her life and conduct,
kind to all, and of a meek and quiet spirit.
She was, with several others of the people called Quakers, taken up by a warrant,
dated the 25th of the Fifth month, 1684,
for not going to church (so called) and carried to Kendal jail.
After some time, she had liberty for a few days to be at her brother`'s house;
but complaint being made against the keeper, she was sent for,
and she was not easy till she returned to prison, for she said, '`That is my place,
and my present home; there I have most peace and content.`'

About two months after her commitment, that is, the 17th of Seventh month,
she was taken sick in prison, and her mother coming to visit her,
asked if she had a mind to go home; she replied, '`No, no; I am at home in my place,
to my full content; and if my God so order it that I be dissolved,
I had rather die here than in any other place.
I am glad that I got to this place before I began to be sick:
here I have peace and true content in the will of God, whether life or death.
I am only grieved that there should be so little
tenderness or pity in the hearts of my persecutors,
to keep such a poor young one as I am in prison.
The Lord forgive them, I can freely.`'
She further said, that her imprisonment was by the permission of the Almighty,
who is greater, and above the greatest of my persecutors,
who I believe will shortly set me free from these, and all other bonds,
over all their heads; and in his peace, in true patience I possess my soul,
and am contented, if it be his will, to be dissolved.`'
A friend asked her why she was so willing to die.
"`Oh,`" said she, '`I have seen glorious sights of good things.`'
The friend queried, '`What things?`' she answered,
'`They are so excellent and glorious that it is not utterable;
and now I have nothing but love and good-will to all.`'
But more especially she was glad in the love and unity she felt with friends; with whom,
said she, '`I have been often refreshed in our meetings together,
with the refreshment that comes from the presence of the Lord.
Oh! the good evening meetings we have had.`'
Another time she said to her mother,
'`They say that we shall spend all our riches with lying here in prison; no,
our riches are durable, and our treasure hidden, laid up in heaven.`'

Her mother seeing her lie under great weight of sickness, would sometimes weep;
but she was always troubled at it, and said, '`Dear mother, do not weep,
but resign me freely up into the hand of the Lord.
Weep not for me, for I am well, Christ my Redeemer is with me.`'
And to her sister she said, '`Come sister, lie down by me, do not sorrow for me,
I am well content to live or die; for my God has blessed me, and will bless me,
and his blessings rest upon me.`'
A little before she departed, her speech failed; after which she would sing in her heart;
lifting up her hands with a cheerful countenance,
and taking her friends by the hand with great affection,
so fell asleep in the Lord on the 28th of the Seventh month, in the year 1684,
in the seventeenth year of her age.

DAVID BARCLAY, of Urie, in the kingdom of Scotland, father of Robert Barclay,
the great and eminent apologist for true Christianity,
was convinced of truth in the Seventh month, in the year 1666,
being then in the fifty-sixth year of his age; and abode in the truth,
and in constant unity with the faithful friends thereof to the end;
having suffered the spoiling of his goods, and many other indignities,
besides several tedious imprisonments, after the sixty-sixth year of his age.

In the latter end of the Seventh month, 1686,
being past the seventy-sixth year of his age, he was taken with a fever,
which continued upon him for two weeks;
during which time he signified that he had a quiet and contented mind,
freely resigned up to the will of God.
About two days before he died, being troubled with the gravel, and much pain,
in an agony he said, '`I am going now;`' but instantly checking himself, added,
'`but I shall go to the Lord, and be gathered to many of my brethren,
who are gone before me.`'
Upon the 11th day of the Eighth month, between two and three in the morning,
he growing weaker, his eldest son drew nigh to him, and he said, '`Is this my son?`'
Robert answered, '`Yes;`' signifying his travail,
that he that loved him might be near him to the end.
To which he answered, '`The Lord is nigh.`'
Repeating it once again, he said, '`You are my witnesses in the presence of God,
that the Lord is nigh.`'
A little after he said, '`The perfect discovery of the day-spring from on high;
how great a blessing it has been to me and my family!`'

Robert Barclay`'s wife desiring to know if he would have something to wet his mouth,
he answered, '`It needs not.`'
She said it would refresh him; he then laid his hand upon his breast,
saying he had that inwardly that refreshed him: and after a little while he added,
'`The truth is over all.`'
He took his eldest son Robert to him, and blessed him,
and prayed God he might never depart from the truth.
When his son`'s eldest daughter came near, he said, '`Is this Patience?
Let patience have its perfect work in you.`'
And after kissing his son`'s other four children, he laid his hands upon them,
and blessed them.
Perceiving one by, (who was not a friend in the truth,) weeping much,
he wished she might come to the truth, bidding her not weep for him, but for herself.

A sober man, an apothecary that waited upon him in his sickness, coming near,
he took him by the hand, saying, '`You will bear me witness,
that in all this exercise I have not been curious to tamper, nor to pamper the flesh.`'
The man said, '`Sir,
I can bear witness that you have always minded the better and more substantial part,
and rejoice to see the blessed end the Lord is bringing you to.`'
He replied, '`Bear a faithful and true witness;
yet it is the life of righteousness (repeating these
words twice over) that we bear testimony to,
and not empty profession.`'
He, supposing a man that was by him to be a carpenter, said to his son,
'`See you charge him to make no superfluity upon my coffin.`'

About three in the afternoon there came several friends from Aberdeen to visit him,
and he took them by the hand, and said they were come in a seasonable time.
And after some words were spoken, and Patrick Livingston had prayed,
which ended in praises, he held up his hands, and said, '`Amen, Amen, Amen, forever.`'
After they stood up, looking at him, he said,
'`How precious is the love of God among his children, and their love one to another.
Hereby shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.
How precious a thing it is to see brethren dwell together in love!
My love is with you; I leave it among you.`'
Perceiving some of his friends to weep, he said, '`Dear friends, all mind the inward man,
heed not the outward; there is one that does regard, the Lord of Hosts is his name.`'
After he had heard the clock strike three, in the afternoon, he said,
'`Now the time comes.`'
And a little after he was heard to say, '`Praises, praises, praises to the Lord:
let now your servant depart in peace.
Into your hands, O Father, I commit my soul, spirit, and body.
Your will, O Lord, be done on earth as it is in heaven.`'
A little after five in the morning, on the 12th day of the Eighth month,
in the year 1686, he fell asleep like a lamb, in remarkable quietness and calmness;
there being standing about him, to behold his end, about twenty persons,
who were witnesses to what is above said.

JOSEPH FULLER, a young man about twenty-five years of age, son of Abraham Fuller,
of Queen`'s County, in Ireland, having been sick three days,
his father desired some relations to sit down,
and wait upon the Lord in Joseph`'s chamber.
He being asked if it was not tiresome to sit so long, his answer was,
'`I bless the Lord for this opportunity.`'
His brother`'s wife asking him how he did, he said, '`I have had a wearisome night;
but I have had joy in the presence of the Lord.`'
Next night he sang praises to the Lord, and said to his sister, '`Never, since I was born,
such words came from me; this is from the Lord.`'
More he said to the same purpose to his father, and further said to him,
'`Tell all my brothers and sisters,
that they take their minds from the things of this world,
and have their minds fixed upon the Lord.`'
Taking his father by the hand, he said, '`Farewell, farewell.`'
Afterwards he said, '`Well, I thought to have gone when I bid you farewell,
(his sister being also with his father,) but I shall not go yet.`'
A little while after he said to his sister, '`Jane, I am long a dying.`'

About a quarter of an hour before he drew his last breath, he said to his sister,
'`See what hour it is.`'
She replied, '`It is seven.`'
Then he asked her, '`lies my head right for dying?
If it does not lie right, do you lay it right.`'
She told him it did lie right.
So he lay until he drew his last breath,
which was a quarter past the seventh hour in the morning,
on the 17th of the Seventh month, in the year 1686.
Aged about twenty-five years.

ROBERT WIDDERS, born in Upper Kellet, in Lancashire, of honest parents,
was a seeker after the Lord, and the knowledge of his way;
and when George Fox visited those parts, he received the knowledge of the truth,
which was in the year 1652.
He was a faithful servant of Christ, and labored for the good of souls; and to that end,
in the year 1671, he travelled with George Fox in many parts of America, as Barbados,
Virginia, Maryland, Jamaica, Long Island, Rhode Island, etc.,
and great perils they went through both by sea and land, and in the wilderness,
and lying in the woods, in danger of wild beasts, and through all the Lord supported him,
and kept him faithful to the end.

He was many times concerned to go to the public places
of worship to call the people to repentance,
for which he endured hard sufferings, as at Coldbeck steeple-house,
where the people threw him down among the seats,
afterwards dragged him out into the yard, and threw him on the ground,
punching and beating him so cruelly, that the blood gushed out at his mouth,
and he lay for dead.

For speaking to the people at Acton steeple-house, he was sent to Carlisle jail,
where he lay in a dungeon among thieves a long time,
and was not allowed to come out day nor night, till he was released.
At Lamplough steeple-house they tore the clothes upon his back,
and the hair off his head; and in Bishop Aulkland,
speaking to the people as he passed through the town, they stoned him with stones,
which very sorely bruised his head.

He afterwards travelled into Scotland with George Fox,
and there went to a steeple-house called New Munckland, besides many other places,
where in the fear of God, and love to the people`'s souls,
he was constrained to direct them to the word of God in their hearts.
Through all which sufferings the Lord kept and preserved him by his power,
blessed be his everlasting name forever.

Also, for his faithfulness in his testimony against tithes,
and for the true worship of God in spirit and truth, he had much spoil of his goods;
but when his cattle, corn, and household goods were as it were by wholesale swept away,
he was not in the least dejected nor concerned, knowing well for what he suffered:
his loss on these accounts was of considerable value.

He was faithful, noble and valiant for God`'s truth, over all its gainsayers;
though he was not large in declaration, yet he was large in integrity and zeal,
and was endowed with a word of wisdom, and in discerning and sound judgment,
and gave good advice and admonition to friends,
for establishing them in the faith wherever he came;
and the Lord prospered his work in his hand.

During the time of his sickness he was in a resigned frame of mind,
given up to the will of God, and spoke of the mercies of God to his church, saying,
'`God will comfort Zion, and repair her decayed places, and make her desert as a paradise,
and her wilderness as a garden of the Lord: mirth and joy shall be found there,
thanksgiving and the voice of praise.`'
At another time, speaking of his own experience,
he said that the work of righteousness is peace,
and the effect of righteousness is quietness and assurance forever.
He would often upon his deathbed say his heart was filled with the love of God;
and that there was nothing between him and the Lord.
Saying to the Lord, '`You have taught me the way of life, and make me full of life,
and make me full of joy with your countenance.`'

His love to God, and good-will to his brethren,
filled his heart with tender and heavenly comfort,
so that within two hours before his death, he discoursed sensibly with friends about him,
and passed quietly and patiently away, in the First month 1686,
after he had been a believer in the truth thirty-four years,
being then in the sixty-eighth year of his age.

ANN WHITEHEAD, wife of George Whitehead, of London,
was an early believer in the blessed truth.
In the year 1656 she travelled on foot about two hundred miles, into Cornwall,
to visit George Fox and other Friends in Launceston prison, in that county;
and in that journey convinced many people, some of whom were of account;
and in her return confirmed and established several who were newly convinced.
She continued a faithful woman to the end,
and was very serviceable in the church of Christ, not only in respect to her ministry,
but also to the poor widows and orphans, and to the sick, whom she did truly consider,
and spared not herself to serve them who were in distress,
so that nothing might be lacking.

In the year 1686, finding herself indisposed in health,
she went a few miles out of London to a friend`'s house, where, continuing weak,
about four days before her decease, she declared in the presence of several, saying,
'`Friends, I would not have you too much concerned about me; as to my going hence.
I am in the hand of the Lord.
I desire the God of peace and love may be among all Friends,
and that they may be kept in love, and peace, and concord,
unto which we were gathered in the beginning;
and that the same that gathered us in the beginning,
may always preserve Friends in the spirit of love, and of the same mind:
as the God of love and peace may please to dispose of me, I am content in his will.`'

Her ancient friend, Mary Stout of Hartford, visiting her,
and she being asked if she knew her, replied, '`Yes, very well; it is Mary Stout.
I have my memory very well, and my understanding is clear, though I am very weak;
but I am given up to the will of the Lord, whether to die or live;
for I have been faithful to him in what I knew, both in life and death.`'
When she discovered any friends to be troubled, she would say,
'`There is no cause for you to be troubled or concerned, for I am well, and in peace,
and have nothing to do.`'

Besides the many seasonable, tender and Christian exhortations and counsels,
which on her dying-bed she gave, in the love of God, to particular friends,
some friends from London coming to visit her, she said,
'`What! do you come on purpose to see me!
I take it as an effect of the love of God; and I pray God bless your children.`'
Another time to one of the same friends, she said, '`Remember me to all friends.
I pray God bless your families, and if I never see your face more, it is well with me.
God does know my integrity, and how I have been, and walked before him;
and I am in charity with all Friends; and be not over careful, or troubled for me,
but be retired and quiet.`'

The evening before she died she said to her husband, George Whitehead,
'`The Lord is with me; I bless his name; I am well.
It may be you are afraid I shall be taken away; and if it be,
the will of the Lord be done.
Do not trouble yourselves, nor make any great ado about me; but, my dear, go to bed,
go to rest; and if I should speak no more words to you,
you know the everlasting love of God.`'
Another time, said she had done with all things in this life;
that she had nothing troubled her, but was at true peace and ease every way.
And but a few hours before she departed, said, '`Though I am in a dying condition,
yet it is a living death; and though weakness does seize on my body,
yet my understanding and sense is as perfect and clear as when I was in perfect health.`'
And so, in true love and charity with all,
she quietly departed this life on the 27th of the Fifth month, in the year 1686.

BARBARA SCAIF, daughter of William Scaif and Isabel his wife, of Blackside, near Appleby,
in the county of Westmoreland, with her sister Mary,
were both taken sick on the 30th day of the First month, 1686,
within one and the same hour, of the small-pox; and were both of them dutiful children,
fearing God, and making profession of the principle of light and life in Christ Jesus,
to which the people called Quakers bear testimony.

At the beginning of their sickness, many of the neighbors came to visit them;
but Barbara said, '`Mother, permit but a few to stay.
When they have seen us, desire them to go into the house,
for we have no need of such empty talk as is used among too many.
We would be quiet,
that we may pray to the Lord to forgive us the faults we have committed;
and if he spare us our lives at this time, I hope and believe we shall amend,
and have a care of displeasing the Lord while we live.`'
About the seventh day of her sickness she prayed to the Lord, saying, '`O, Almighty God!
I cry to you; blot out all my transgressions, O Lord, and all my sins;
let them come no more into your remembrance.
I beg it of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, with all my soul, and with all my strength;
and let your favorable countenance be upon me.`'

She also prayed that the Lord would confirm and strengthen her weak sister,
to give up herself freely, as she blessed the Lord she herself had done;
and then prayed for her parents; and many supplications besides, for a considerable time,
in the presence of several people that were not called Quakers, who said,
'`How can any die better than she is like to do?`'
To her brother she said, '`Be faithful to the Lord, and to your religion,`' etc.
Being asked if she could freely part with her dear relations, her answer was,
'`I can freely part with, and leave them all,
for the enjoyment of the comfort and happiness which my soul is
made sensible of;`' and praised the Lord for the riches of his grace
and comfort that she had received from him to her immortal soul.
Being pressed to receive some meat, she said, '`Do not trouble me with meat,
for if thereby you think to keep me, it is all in vain, for I must die and leave you.
Neither would I desire to live for all the world;
for to be with the Lord is better than ten thousand worlds,
with whom I shall rest forevermore, even with God and his saints,
his faithful people and servants: glory to his name forevermore.`'

In her sickness she manifested great love to her parents,
and also to her sick sister Mary, saying, '`Go to her, do not stay with me,
whatever may befall me; that too sharp sickness may not fall on her,
until she know her peace with God.`'
To her brother she gave religious counsel, saying, '`Love the Lord with all your heart,
and with all your soul, all your life-time; love not the world,
nor the pleasures thereof.`'
All the time of her sickness she was tender in her spirit, and circumspect,
not an unbecoming word proceeded out of her mouth; kind and pitiful to those about her,
not so much concerned at her own sickness, as for them who attended her,
considering the trouble they had in helping her.

That day she had lain a month sick (being much like
as she had been for three weeks before),
she was very cheerful, and able to express herself, and said to her mother,
'`What do you think of this forenoon?`'
Her mother asked her what she meant: she replied,
'`It will go far in my time in this world, for the Lord will ease me before long,
take away all my pain, and wipe away all tears from my eye.
Call in my father (said she) that he may see my departure.`'
Her father being come, he said, '`Barbara, how do you?`'
She replied, '`I am ready to leave this world; therefore, father and mother, be content,
and bear me company a little while.`'
And about the first hour in the afternoon she departed this life,
as if she had fallen asleep, on the 27th of Second month, in the year 1686.

MARY SCAIF was elder sister to the aforesaid Barbara,
taken sick the same hour that she was,
and for whom her sister Barbara had been often tenderly concerned in supplication to God,
to give her the knowledge of his peace that has no end.
She lived about two weeks after her said sister, her sickness being also the small-pox;
and in the Lord`'s time, who keeps covenant, and shows mercy,
and gives the spirit of supplication and prayer to them that believe,
he gave her a clear understanding, and she prayed unto God as follows: '`great God,
Jehovah, of heaven and earth, whose splendor fills heaven,
and your wonders fill the earth, have mercy upon me your hand-maid,
who am as a worm before you, yet part of your creation.
Lord, help my weak soul, revive my drooping spirit:
by your consoling presence strengthen my faith, I beseech you,
and help me through this exercise.
I beseech you, Lord, that your will may be done in earth,
as it is done in heaven;`' and continued in prayer a considerable time,
supplicating for a willing mind, to resign herself up to God.

She was much inclined from a child to read the holy Scriptures;
and she often spoke of Job, David, and others of God`'s servants in former ages.
'`And now,`' said she, '`I do know God`'s love to be the same to me as it was to them,
so that I am neither afraid nor unwilling to die; for God blots out my transgressions,
and lays nothing to my charge,
and I do believe there is a place prepared for me in heaven.
And, dear mother, do what you can not to sorrow.
My love is great to you, and my advice is, that you go and live near some good meeting,
and bring up my brother among friends.`'
Her sister being dead, she spoke of her own death also,
and was satisfied that her soul should ascend up to God in heaven, '`where,`' said she,
'`I believe my sister Barbara`'s soul is ascended, to rest with the Lord forever.`'
Her sickness increasing, she grew weaker,
and departed this life on the 13th of the Third month, in the year 1686.

AMARIAH DREWET, of Cirencester, in Gloucestershire, preached in his life and conduct;
for he was faithful according to the measure the Lord had given him,
and turned not his back in time of suffering,
but rather blessed the Lord that he was found worthy
to be one of that number to have his faith tried,
often praying for his persecutors.

On the 11th of the Seventh month, 1686, he was visited with sickness,
and the Lord so filled his soul with his love and presence,
that three days before his death he signified,
if it was the last testimony he had to bear,
the love and presence and peace of God was with him; and that he could truly say,
as good old Simeon did, that he had seen the salvation of God.
The night before his departure he said to his wife, '`Go to bed, you have need of rest,
and give me up to the Lord, whose presence I feel, and I resign you up;
may the Keeper of Israel, that good watchman, that neither slumbers nor sleeps,
be with you.`'

At other times he prayed, '`O Lord, strengthen my poor body, that I may praise your name;
my rest is in you.
Oh! the largeness of your love that I feel.
O Lord, hear my cries, and bear up my head in all my exercises.
Oh! your sweet presence, and fresh springs that I feel!
Glory and honor, and praises, be unto your name forever.`'
Again, '`Lord help me, and keep me close to your power.`'
With many other petitions that he put up to the Lord;
admonishing people who came to visit him, and warning the young to fear God,
and watch against those things that did corrupt youth; exhorting them to faithfulness,
that it might be well with them upon their dying bed, as it was with him.
He uttered many more heavenly expressions, which are omitted for brevity.
He lay half an hour, as if he had been asleep, and went away quietly,
without sigh or groan; and so departed this life, on the 25th of the Seventh month,
in the year 1686.

BENJAMIN PADLEY, son of William and Elizabeth Padley, of North Cave,
in the East Riding of Yorkshire, was a young man that walked in humility,
zeal and love towards God, and to all who walked in his truth.
The Lord was pleased to raise him to bear testimony to his everlasting truth,
in the assemblies of his people;
and his great delight was in the prosperity of the truth,
for which he faithfully and zealously labored to the end of his days,
having regard to the motion of God`'s spirit in his ministry,
and lived according to his testimony.
He was sound, plain, and weighty in his declaration, and kept low and humble,
in a deep sense of the need he had to wait upon God, for the renewing of his mercies,
and fresh openings of the springs of life and love from God,
to help him forward in his spiritual travail, that he might persevere to the end;
and to which he did much exhort, and stir up Friends where he came.

He was taken sick the 17th of Sixth month, 1687;
which sickness continued about eight days.
In this time several Friends, and also neighbors and relations, came to see him;
and in the sense of God`'s love he declared truth among them.
There being some present who did not profess the same truth with us, he said,
'`It is not for any outward thing we travel abroad;
not any man`'s silver or gold that we seek or covet after;
but it is for the gaining of souls.
We have suffered the loss of our goods, scoffings, scornings, and imprisonments;
so that it may appear that it has not been the benefit of
any man`'s goods or estate that has been in our eye,
but for performing the will of the Lord.`'
Several of his neighbors being present, he said, '`It is well for them that can say,
on their dying beds, that their sins and iniquities are blotted out.`'
He prayed to the Lord, that he would mix mercies with his afflictions;
and exhorted friends to faithfulness and righteousness.
Observing his wife to weep, he said, '`O, why do you so?
You must not do so; but keep to truth, and fear not but all will be well.`'
At night he said to her, '`Go to bed, and be not troubled about me.`'
Friends visiting him, he said, '`I am glad to see so many of your faces,
which I thought I should not have done,
being the Lord has been pleased to visit me with sickness,
so that I am not likely to continue many days here; but I feel nothing, but all is well.`'
When his friends would be careful about some physician to help him, he said,
'`I have a physician the world knows not of.`'

When he drew near his end he desired to be helped upon his knees,
and was so powerful in prayer to the Lord, considering the weakness of his body,
that it was an admiration to all present.
After that, few words proceeded from him, but he weakened quickly,
and the next day departed this life, being the 25th of the Sixth month,
in the year 1687.

SARAH FEATHERSTONE, daughter of Joseph Featherstone and Sarah his wife,
aged about fifteen years, was inclined in her tender years to hear the voice of wisdom,
and to remember her Creator in the days of her youth.
From a child she was harmless, and obedient to her parents,
and of a meek and quiet spirit.
She was taken sick the 9th of the Seventh month, 1688.

Her mother coming to her, she told her that she thought she should be taken from her;
and when her mother would send for a doctor,
she said she was freely given up to the will of the Lord, whether to live or die.
She farther said it was showed her that she was not of a long life; and,
'`if this be the time of my change, I am content.`'
Her sickness increasing, her mother was much concerned; at which she was troubled,
and said, '`Dear mother, your dear and tender love to me has been very great,
and in that love I desire we may rest, freely given up to the will of God;
for the Lord may not see fit to trust me in this wicked world any longer.`'
And farther she said,
'`Oh! the abominable pride of this world! and there are some among us who can
take liberty to fashion themselves in many things like unto the world,
both in their habit and other needless things.
Oh! but the Christian life is another thing;
this is not the adorning that we are to put on; for if the righteous scarcely be saved,
where shall the wicked and ungodly appear?`'

Her distemper being violent, she then said, '`Never so sick in my life;
O! sick at my heart!
O Lord, in mercy remember me, and bear me up above all my afflictions,
for my heart trusts in you.`'
Being asked by her mother whether she would be buried by her father,
or at another burying-place, she answered, '`Dear mother,
bury me where you and my father (her father-in-law) please, I leave it to you;
it is no matter how many miles distant these bodies lie,
our souls shall one day rejoice together;`' with more words,
bidding them about her not to trouble her, or give her any thing, without she desired it.
She lay still in a good frame of mind, with a sweet countenance,
bearing her sickness in much patience; often saying,
'`O! my dear and heavenly Father! come away, come away, for my heart trusts in you.`'
And so fell asleep in the Lord, the 17th of the Seventh month, in the year 1688,
aged fifteen years.

GEORGE GRAY, of Acquorthies, in Scotland, was a sufferer for the truth;
a poor man in this world, yet rich in faith; of mean education,
yet endowed with divine wisdom;
and bore a sound and faithful testimony among the Lord`'s people.

A little before his departure, being filled with the power of the Lord,
he gave weighty exhortations to all present, especially to his children.
To some friends that came to see him,
he said he had not kept back the word and counsel of the Lord from them;
and now he could say, it was good doctrine, to leave nothing to do till a dying bed:
so finished his testimony, and laid down his body the 8th day of the Twelfth month,
in the year 1689.

GEORGE FOX was born in the Fifth month, 1624, at Drayton, in Leicestershire.
At eleven years of age he knew purity and holiness.
In the nineteenth year of his age, in the year 1643, he left all,
and travelled up and down the nation, visiting many people who were seeking the Lord,
until the year 1646, at which time he entered into his more public ministry;
for he was sent of God, as the apostles were in the primitive times,
to turn people from darkness to light,
directing all to mind the light of Christ Jesus in their own hearts.
In the year 1648,
several meetings of Friends were gathered to God`'s teaching through his ministry;
in which ministry he faithfully labored forty-four years,
through much suffering and many perils of various sorts,
as by the journal of his life does largely appear.

God gave him length of days, so that he saw his children in the faith,
unto the third and fourth generation, to a great increase.
Great was his care for the preservation of those who had received truth,
that they might walk in the same; and to that end he gave forth many faithful epistles,
and good exhortation and advice, for good order and discipline in the church of Christ,
as appears in the collection of his epistles to friends.

He preached the gospel effectually but two days before he died,
on the 11th of the Eleventh month, 1690, at Gracechurch-street meetinghouse in London.
After meeting, he said, '`I am glad I was here; now I am clear,
I am fully clear;`' and then was the same day taken ill of some indisposition of body,
and continued weak in body for two days, at the house of Henry Goldney,
at White-hart-court, in Gracechurch-street,
and lay in much contentedness and peace to the end, being very sensible.
In this time he mentioned many Friends, and sent for some in particular,
to whom he expressed his mind for spreading truth and Friends`' books in the world;
signifying also to some Friends, saying, '`All is well,
and the seed of God reigns over all, and over death itself; and though I am weak in body,
yet the power of the Lord is over all,
and over all disorderly spirits;`' which were his customary sensible expressions,
being in the living faith and sense thereof, which he kept to the end.

On the 13th of the Eleventh month, in the year 1690,
he quietly departed this life in peace, about the tenth hour in the night:
so he ended his days in a faithful testimony,
in perfect love and unity with his brethren,
being about the sixty-sixth year of his age.

JOAN VOKINS, wife of Richard Vokins, of the county of Berks, was a faithful woman,
and laborer in the gospel.
After she had received God`'s blessed truth,
she was much concerned that her relations also might receive the same truth;
and by her upright conduct and good example among them,
with the blessing of God and assistance of his grace, her husband, father,
and children received the truth; and her husband was a sufferer for the same,
in his imprisonment in Reading jail, and her eldest son also.
Having received a dispensation of the gospel of Jesus
Christ to preach to others in this nation,
she was also concerned in her spirit to visit several
provinces and islands beyond the seas;
and in order thereunto took shipping from Gravesend in Kent, in the Twelfth month, 1679,
and visited New York, East and West Jersey, and some parts of Pennsylvania,
which at that time was not much inhabited, Long Island, Rhode Island, and New England,
and several of the islands, as Antigua, Nevis, and Barbados.

In her journey to these places she endured many hardships
and sufferings of several kinds;
yet through all she was supported by the power of Christ,
whose peace she felt in her soul.
On the 3rd day of the Fourth month, 1681, she returned from Barbados to England,
and landed at Dover in Kent.
At Sandwich she exhorted the priests and people of that town,
in their public place of worship, to forsake their vanity,
and to come to the spiritual worship of God; and laid before them the danger of the one,
and the benefit of the other.

After her return home to England, she continued her diligence in the Lord`'s work,
and care and service in his church, and among his people, to the end of her days.
About the yearly meeting time, in 1690,
she went up to London to visit Friends thereabout; and, but a few weeks before her death,
by a letter, dated from London, in the Fourth month following,
she signified to her dear friend Theophila Townsend,
another faithful woman-laborer in the gospel, at Cirencester,
that now her service was finished; and said,
'`I could gladly have laid down my body here among the Lord`'s worthies; yet,
seeing it is ordered otherwise, I submit to the will of my God,
and do think to go homeward in a little time.`'

Joan Vokins also said, not long before, to the said Theophila Townsend,
being then with her, that she had some papers,
which she desired might be made public after her decease,
expecting her time was not long to remain in the body,
being well satisfied that she should lay down her head in peace with God,
let death come when it would.
And according to the sight she had, and what she said,
the time of her decease was near at hand, for she did not live to get home,
after she wrote the letter aforesaid in the Fourth month at London.
Coming to Reading, she fell sick there, and upon her dying bed spoke to her son,
Richard Vokins, as follows: '`Son, my weakness is great, and my pains very strong;
but the Lord is large in his love to me, and good to me;
he gives me patience to bear my pains, which are strong.
Ah, son, I have learned a good lesson; Paul`'s lesson; in all states to be content;
and now I have nothing to do but to die.`'
Putting forth her hand to take her leave of him, she farther said, '`Son,
remember the Lord, and he will remember you: remember my love to your wife,
and to all my children.`'
And after a little stop, and her speech low, she spoke these words again,
'`And he will remember you; and be faithful to him, and he will bless you,
and you shall be blessed.`'

She departed this life the 22nd of the Fifth month, in the year 1690,
having finished her course, and kept the faith.

ROBERT LODGE, of the county of York, was convinced of truth in the year 1660,
and was a faithful minister of Christ Jesus,
and a valiant sufferer for the testimony of a good conscience.
He travelled in the work of the gospel, both in England and in Ireland,
and turned many to righteousness, and did build up many in the most holy faith:
he was not only a planter but a waterer in the vineyard: a son of consolation indeed.

The time of his sickness was but short.
A friend visiting him, he gave account of his infirmities, and questioned his recovery:
but he said, '`The Lord knows my heart, that I have served him;
and it has been of more account to me, the gaining of one soul,
than all my labors and travels.`'

The friend going again the next day, and seeing him near his end, was sorrowful;
to whom he said, '`What! we must meet again,
we must meet again in eternity;`' and put up many heavenly petitions to the Lord.
Another friend taking leave of him, he called him by his name, and said,
'`It is well with me, and I have no disturbance in my mind.`'
And again he said, '`The Lord knows I was never commissioned to go any way,
or to do any thing, but I have willingly answered him; and the Lord,
who has been my rock and refuge, my shield and buckler, and a sanctuary to me,
has been with me all along to this very day.`'
He spoke much more in praises to the Lord for his many deliverances,
praying for the continuance of God`'s life and love to his whole heritage.
After which he spoke little, but that all was well with him; and said, '`Blessed be God,
I have heavenly peace;`' and so fell into a sweet sleep, and went away,
being on the 15th of the Seventh month, in the year 1690.

STEPHEN CRISP, of Colchester in Essex, received the blessed truth about the year 1655,
when he was about twenty-seven years of age,
and was a preacher of the everlasting gospel of Christ Jesus about thirty-five years.
In that service he travelled in many parts of England, Scotland, Holland, Germany,
and the Low Countries, as by the printed journal of his life more largely appears,
and endured many hardships for his faithful testimony to the blessed truth.
He was greatly capable, through his long experience,
to advise and give counsel to persons in all conditions.

In the latter part of his days, being unable to travel much,
through an indisposition of body,
yet he was diligent in preaching the gospel in Colchester and London.
He lay some time under great exercise and weakness; and about four days before he died,
being under much bodily weakness and pain, he said to George Whitehead,
who came to visit him, '`I see an end of mortality, yet cannot come at it;
I desire the Lord to deliver me out of this troublesome and painful body.
If he will but say the word, it is done.
Yet there is no cloud in my way.
I have a full assurance of my peace with God in Christ Jesus;
my integrity and uprightness of heart is known to the Lord,
and I have peace and justification in Christ Jesus, who made me so; that is,
upright to God;`' and remembered his love to all the faithful in the church of God.
To another friend he said, '`I have fought the good fight of faith,
and have run my course, and am waiting for the crown of life that is laid up for me.`'

To a friend who visited him, he said, '`Serve the truth for the simple truth`'s sake,
and it will preserve you to the end, as it has done me.`'
In his great pain of body, feeling the word of patience to support him,
he said to the friends watching with him, '`Grow in the word of patience,
that it may keep you also in the time of need.`'
The day before he died, he said,
'`I hope I am gathering,`' (as his expression was understood,) '`I hope,
I hope,`' being then hardly able to speak out his words.
George Whitehead, near parting from him, said, '`Dear Stephen,
would you have any thing to friends?`'
After some pause, he gave this answer, '`Remember my dear love in Christ Jesus to all.`'
And on the 28th day of the Sixth month, in the year 1692, he died in the Lord,
at Wandsworth, near London, about the sixty-fourth year of his age.

GULIELMA MARIA PENN was the wife of William Penn, of Pennsylvania,
and daughter of Sir William Springet, of Durling.
Her illness continued eight months upon her,
in which time she uttered many living and weighty expressions upon several occasions,
both before and near her end.
At one of the meetings held in her chamber,
only her husband and children and one of the servants being present,
in a living power she said, '`Let us all prepare, not knowing what hour, or watch,
the Lord comes.
O! I am full of matter!
Shall we receive good, and shall we not receive evil at the hand of the Lord?
I have cast my care upon the Lord, he is the physician of value;
my expectation is wholly from him; he can raise up, and he can cast down.`'
A while after she said, '`O! what shall be done to the unprofitable servant!`'

At another meeting, before which much heaviness seemed to lie upon her natural spirits,
she said, '`This has been a precious opportunity to me,
I am finely relieved and comforted, blessed be the Lord.`'
At another time, her husband speaking to her of the peace of well-doing,
she replied to him, '`I never did, to my knowledge, a wicked thing in all my life.`'
To a friend, aged seventy-five years, that came to see her, she said, '`You and I,
to all appearance, are near our end.`'
And to another, about sixty-five years old, who came also to see her, she said,
'`How much older has the Lord made me by this weakness than you are!
But I am content.
I do not murmur.
I submit to his holy will.`'
In the height of her sickness she said,
'`It is the great goodness of the Lord that I should be able to lie thus still.
He is the physician of value to me, can I say.
Let my tongue set forth his praise, and my spirit magnify him while I have breath.
O! I am ready to be transported beyond my strength.
God was not in the thunder, nor in the lightning;
but he was heard in the still small voice.`'
She called the children one day, when very weak, and said, '`Be not frightened, children;
I do not call you to take my leave of you, but to see you;
and would have you walk in the fear of the Lord, and with his people in his holy truth.`'
Speaking another time solemnly to her children, she said,
'`I never desired any great things for you, but that you may fear the Lord,
and walk in his truth among his people, to the end of your days.`'

About three hours before her end, a relation taking leave of her, she said,
'`I have cast my care upon the Lord;
my dear love to all friends;`' and lifting up her dying hands and eyes,
prayed to the Lord to preserve them and bless them.
About an hour after, causing all to withdraw, she took her leave of her husband,
saying all that was fit upon that solemn occasion.
She continued sensible, and ate something about an hour before her departure;
at which time her children, and most of the family being present,
she quietly expired in her husband`'s arms,
with a sensible and devout resignation of her soul to Almighty God,
on the 23rd of the Twelfth month, in the year 1693, in the fiftieth year of her age.

PATRICK LIVINGSTON was born in the year 1634, near Montrose, in the kingdom of Scotland.
He received the blessed truth about the year 1659,
and travelled much in the service thereof,
bearing a faithful testimony to the same for above thirty years,
in many parts of England and Ireland, and most places in Scotland,
where he was made a good instrument in convincing and gathering
many to the knowledge of the inward appearance of Christ Jesus,
particularly that meeting settled at Kinermuck in Aberdeen county,
the largest meeting in all the nation.
In this county he valiantly and patiently endured
several years`' close imprisonment in Aberdeen,
for his faithful testimony to the truth, that is, from the year 1676 to 1679;
and he likewise bore a faithful testimony for truth, by imprisonment in Newgate,
in London, for a considerable time, about the year 1684.

Valiant he was for the truth, especially in times of persecution.
Like a good soldier, he never turned his back in the day of battle,
but through the strength of the Lord was still among the first in suffering,
being fervent and zealous for the cause of truth and honor of God.
His persecutors were sensible that he was a strengthening to his brethren in prison;
and therefore, that it might not be so, they would several times let him go,
or miss some meeting he was known to be at.
Faithful he was to his brethren in their afflictions, and would not leave them,
till he saw an end to that persecution in Scotland in the year 1679;
and from that time no Friend was imprisoned for several years in that city.

After this he returned into England to his dear wife,
who at that time dwelt in Nottingham, but in his latter years,
he with his family lived in London.
He continued to the end a diligent laborer in the Lord`'s vineyard,
several times visiting his native country of Scotland; and the year before he died,
in 1693, he again visited his brethren there,
and was attended with a plentiful measure of the Lord`'s power and presence,
all the time he was among them, though at that time weak in body.
After his return home he grew weaker,
until he departed this life on the 15th of the Fourth month, 1694,
at the house of John Kirton, in Kensington, near London,
being removed there for the benefit of the air, where several friends were present,
witnesses of the following heavenly expressions:

The day before his departure he said, '`I am in unity with all faithful Friends,
and in love to all men.`'
About an hour before his departure, he said, '`O Father!
O Father!`' A little time after, mentioning his weakness of body,
and as if he desired more strength to utter what was in his mind,
which being then apparently given him, he said, '`Let life reach unto all here:`'
and pulling off his night-cap with his own hand
about half an hour before he was removed hence,
he said, '`Blessed, praised, magnified, and exalted be the mighty, powerful,
great and everlasting name of the Lord God, forevermore.
Oh! that your life may arise in full dominion over all,
and that Friends may feel it so in all their assemblies; that they may be kept in love,
concord and unity together, and show it forth in word, work, testimony,
life and conduct unto all;`' adding, '`Life being over all; here we have all we need,
and here there is a lying down in true submission to the will of the Lord,
and laying down our heads in peace and rest with him forevermore.`'
Which last words he repeated twice, and said, '`Here is victory over death, hell,
and the grave, and resting in peace with the Lord forevermore.`'

He died on the 15th of the Fourth month, in the year 1694,
about the sixtieth year of his age.

ANDREW SOWLE, of London, received the truth as professed by the people called Quakers,
in his young years, and became obedient thereunto,
and gave himself up to the living power thereof,
which enabled him with much cheerfulness to undergo those manifold
afflictions and persecutions with which he was exercised;
for being a just and upright man, he was zealous for the propagation of the truth,
to which, both by conduct and sufferings, he bore a faithful testimony.

He was a printer by trade, and engaged himself freely in the printing Friends`' books,
when he had large offers of advancing himself in the world,
made to him by his other friends and relations, if he would have desisted therefrom.
But his love to truth,
and the desire he had to be instrumental in his calling for spreading it abroad,
would not permit him to hearken to any of those offers.
He freely gave himself up to the service thereof,
even in times of the hottest persecution, believing it his duty so to do,
though therein he should hazard not only his life,
but also that outward substance God had blessed him with.
For several years together he was in continual danger upon that account,
his house being often searched, and his printing materials, as presses, letter, etc.,
as often broken to pieces, and taken away,
as any Friends`' books were found printing by him;
and this they did for many years together.
During this time, though he met with great losses, and had, at one time,
by his adversaries, about a thousand reams of printed books taken from him,
yet he was never heard to complain, but he would say,
he was glad to have any thing to lose for truth,
and that the Lord had made him worthy to be a sufferer for it.
This quiet resignation of himself to the will of God,
caused one of those who came to seize upon his goods,
to do what he could with his partners to put a stop to the seizure;
and when he saw he could not prevail, he went out and wept.
When at another time his adversaries came to take away his printing press,
he was so resigned and easy, in giving up all to his persecutors,
that when they had done their work, and seized upon all, he,
(as he often did in like cases,) set forth meat and drink before them,
according to the command, Rom.
xii., 19, 20, to feed even his very enemies; and his good so overcame their evil,
that some of them departed under a concern;
but one of he chief being filled with malice against the truth, survived not long after,
but died in a miserable condition.

As this sincere man met with great sufferings,
so had he also large experiences of the goodness
of God towards him in many remarkable providences.
At one time he was taken at a meeting of the people called Quakers,
and carried to Newgate, and being examined by Sir Richard Brown, the persecuting mayor,
who, understanding he was a printer, threatened to send him after his brother Twin,
(as he called him,
who some time before suffered in Smithfield for printing
a treasonable book,) to whom this meek man replied,
'`You will not live to see it:`' and the event justified it, for Brown died soon after.

After many exercises and trials many ways, which it would be too long to recite,
he was visited with weakness of body the beginning of the Tenth month, 1695,
and grew weaker and weaker till the 25th of the same month.
His patience and resignation to the will of God, during the time of his weakness,
were such, that he seldom was heard to complain, but would say,
that he was given up to the will of God; saying often,
that he had no dependence on any thing, save upon Christ Jesus, the good Samaritan,
on whom was his whole dependence.

George Whitehead, with another friend, coming to visit him,
he said he had served truth faithfully,
according to what the Lord had been pleased to make manifest to him;
and that in what he had done, he had not sought himself, but the honor of God.
He would often exhort his family to faithfulness,
and his young ones also to seek the Lord in the days of their youth.
His reproofs to those who had done amiss, were so kind and so convincing,
that a servant of his said he stood more in awe of a reproof from him,
than the severest treatment of another.
'`His end,`' said he, '`being in love to convince me,
that I have done that which is not right.`'

William Penn, the night before he departed, came somewhat late to visit him,
and finding him in a sweet composed frame of mind (for indeed
he was to appearance as though he ailed nothing),
asked him how he did; he answered with much cheerfulness,
his satisfaction and peace of mind were great, and that he waited for his change.
The said Friend,
who had been many years acquainted with his industrious and innocent life,
after some discourse with him,
kneeled down and prayed that the Lord would give him the reward of his labor; for,
through him, many blessed truths had been brought into the world, etc.
After prayer was ended, he acknowledged William Penn`'s love,
telling him he was well satisfied in his condition,
and in the truth of God which he had professed;
and that he had nothing to do but to wait in the will of God till his change came:
and so in much love they parted, he signifying his love to, and unity with all Friends,
in the truth.

After that, he lay sweetly retired, waiting for his change,
and had his senses perfectly and clear to the last,
which was about eight the next morning; at which time his wife came to his bedside,
and asked him how he did; he answered, '`Oh Jane, never such a good night as this:`'
and the same minute shut his eyes, and with a hymn of praise to God,
offered up his last breath, and fell asleep, not so much as fetching the least sigh,
nor was any alteration seen in his countenance.
So easily and so quietly did he leave this world, in which he had known much exercise,
and is gone to his everlasting rest, with God`'s faithful servants.

He finished this life the 26th of the Tenth month, in the year 1695,
about eight in the morning, at his house in Holywell-lane, London,
in the sixty-seventh year of his age. Rom. 8:18.
For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time,
are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

SPRINGET PENN, eldest son of William Penn of Worminghurst, late of Pennsylvania,
was a young man about twenty-one years of age.
For more than half a year before it pleased the Lord to visit him with weakness,
he grew more retired, and much disengaged from youthful delights,
showing a remarkable tenderness in meetings, even when they were silent.
But when he saw himself doubtful +++[+++as to health]
he turned his mind and meditations more apparently towards the Lord,
often praying with fervency to the Lord,
and uttering many thankful expressions and praises to him, in a deep and sensible manner,
saying one day, '`I am resigned: what God pleases: he knows what is best:
I would live if it pleased him, that I might serve him: but, O Lord, not my will,
but your will be done.`'
One speaking to him of the things of this world, he answered, '`My eye looks another way,
where the truest pleasure is.`'

Another time, his father going to a meeting, at parting he said, '`Remember me,
my dear father, before the Lord.
Though I cannot go to meetings, yet have I many good meetings:
the Lord comes in upon my spirit.
I have heavenly meetings with him by myself.`'
With more to the same purpose, expressing his sentiments of the vanity of this world,
and of his entering into secret covenant with the Lord,
and his thankfulness for the Lord`'s preservation and goodness to him.
Fixing his eyes upon his sister, he took her by the hand, saying, '`Poor Tishe,
look to good things; poor child, there is no comfort without it.
One drop of the love of God is worth more than all the world.
I know it; I have tasted it.
I have felt as much or more of the love of God in this weakness,
than in all my life before;`' with more that he said to his father.

Taking something one night in bed, just before going to rest, he sat up,
and reverently prayed thus: '`O Lord God, you whose Son said to his disciples,
whatsoever you ask in my name you shall receive, I pray you in his name,
bless this to me this night, and give me rest, if it be your blessed will, O Lord:`'
and accordingly he had a very comfortable night,
of which he took thankful notice the next day.
At another time he expressed his desire to serve the Lord if he lived.
He one day saying thus,
'`I am resolved I will have such a thing done;`' immediately he caught himself,
and fell into this reflection with much contrition, '`O Lord,
forgive me that irreverent and hasty expression.
I am a poor weak creature, and live by you, and therefore I should have said,
'`If it pleases you that I live, I intend to do so or so.
Lord forgive my rash expression.`'
He desired his mother-in-law not to trouble herself for such a poor creature as he;
and to pray for him, that he might live and employ his time more in the Lord`'s service.

To his brother he said, looking awfully upon him, '`Be a good boy,
and know there is a God, a great and mighty God, who is a rewarder of the righteous;
and so he is of the wicked; but their rewards are not the same.
Have a care of idle company, and love good company, and good Friends,
and the Lord will bless you.
I have seen good things for you since my sickness, if you do but fear the Lord;
and if I should not live, remember what I say,
when I am dead and gone;`' with many more religious expressions.
Taking his leave of his father, brother, and sister, he said, '`Come life, come death,
I am resigned.
Oh! the love of God overcomes my soul.`'
Feeling himself decline quickly,
and one seeing him not able to bring up the matter that was in his throat,
went to fetch the doctor; but so soon as he came, he said,
'`Let my father speak to the doctor, and I`'ll go to sleep;`' which he did,
and waked no more.

He died the 10th of the Second month, in the year 1696,
in the twenty-first year of his age.

RICHARD BAKER, of Jordan`'s in Buckinghamshire, received the truth in the love of it,
many years since, and he testified his love to it; 1st. In a circumspect walking,
showing himself a pattern of good works.
2ndly.
By suffering cheerfully for it, and took joyfully the spoiling of his goods,
and the imprisonment of his body; and would often say,
'`If people knew the pleasure of godliness, they would not live in the earth as they did.`'
3rdly.
By a hearty zeal for the prosperity and propagation of it.

A vigilant watchman he was in his station, a sharp reprover of evil,
and an encourager of the good, and a diligent laborer in the work of the ministry,
earnestly endeavoring to bring those he ministered
to into an inward exercise of spirit towards God,
that therein they might be more acquainted with, and subject, to the divine power of God:
concerning which he wrote a treatise, published since he deceased,
although it was written about twenty-six years before;
the reasons whereof he gave upon his dying bed, namely,
that he had read of many in former days, and had observed some in his own time,
who had made fair progress in the way of truth; and had said, done,
and suffered much on behalf of it, who yet had not held out to the end;
but through too great security, or self-confidence,
and for lack of a continual subjection to the power of God,
in and by which alone strength and preservation are to be found,
have by the violent assaults, the subtle insinuations,
or mysterious workings of the enemy, been drawn back again under the power of Satan,
to the invalidating (at least in the eye of the world) the testimonies
such had before given to the sufficiency of the power of God.
And he having by others`' miscarriages learned to beware, had,
from a godly jealousy over himself, suspended the publication of the said sheets,
until he could with greater confidence, and more full assurance,
say with the holy apostle, when the time of his departure was at hand,
"`I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith,`" etc.,
which bespoke his great modesty.
Upon his dying-bed, he had the witness in himself that God was pleased with him,
and had a suitable word to every one`'s state that came to him;
and would often clap his hand on his breast, and say, '`All is well here.`'

The day before he departed, many Friends visiting him,
he spoke to all in expressions of great love, and took his leave of them;
and taking his leave of a child who wept, he said, '`Do not cry, I am well,
my peace is made with the Lord.
If you cry, cry that iniquity may be brought down and righteousness brought up.
The power of God and strength of God is with me.
I am going the way of all flesh; I am going before, and others must follow after.`'
So he laid down his life, in the feeling of that power, about the year 1697.

ROBERT BARROW, born in the county of Lancaster,
but removed and brought up from a child in Westmoreland,
was early convinced of God`'s blessed truth,
and was a zealous laborer in the gospel for twenty-six years,
and a faithful sufferer for the same in London, and other places;
traveling much in this nation, and twice through Scotland, Ireland, and Wales,
to preach Christ Jesus, the light of the world.

In the year 1694 he went forth in the love of God, in company with Robert Wardel,
of Sunderland, both of them being ancient men, to preach the gospel in America.
After they had visited Pennsylvania, and some other parts on the continent,
they took shipping for Jamaica,
where Robert Wardel died the 22nd day of the Second month, in the year 1696.
After Robert Barrow had finished his testimony there,
he took shipping in order for Pennsylvania again, and on the 23rd of the Sixth month,
1696, embarked with various passengers and seamen on board the barque Reformation,
Joseph Kirle, master.
But on the 23rd of the Seventh month, by a storm in the Gulf of Florida,
the vessel ran aground, and to save their lives,
they were forced among the savage cannibals of Florida,
and underwent grievous sufferings of various kinds, being often in great danger of death;
traveling naked in heat and cold, hunger and thirst,
and having no proper food to eat from +++[+++the time of]
their suffering shipwreck, that is,
from the 23rd of the Seventh month to the 15th of the Ninth month following.

At last they arrived at a poor garrison town called St. Augustine,
belonging to the Spaniards in America, maintained partly by the king of Spain,
and partly by the Pope; but the governor, etc., were courteous and generous,
according to their ability, who, after they had clothed and refreshed them,
assisted them to Carolina, which province they reached on the 23rd of the Tenth month,
1696; but several of their company died under the hardships they met with.
Robert Barrow,
by feeding upon such unwholesome food (that little
which they did eat,) was taken with a flux,
which continued upon him;
and together with the great sufferings he underwent in his journeys, being ancient,
he was thereby much decayed in his body;
but his desire was to see his friends once more in Philadelphia,
and he reached Philadelphia from Charleston, in Carolina, in fourteen days.

One remarkable passage I may not omit, namely, the company Robert Barrow was with,
to save their lives, assumed the name of Spaniards,
for the savage Indians stood in fear of them;
and this true-hearted man being directly asked the question, '`Are you a Nickaleer?`'
which is an Englishman; he answered, '`Yes.`'
For his plain dealing, he was stripped naked of his clothes, which till then he had saved.
God permitted not these savages to touch his life, nor the lives of those with him;
though at one time these bloody creatures placed themselves each behind one,
having their arms extended, with their knives in their hands,
ready to execute their bloody design, some taking hold of them by their heads,
with their knees set against their shoulders, waiting for their chief to begin.
They were very high in words, which the English understood not;
but on a sudden it pleased God to work wonderfully for their preservation,
and instantly all these savage men were struck dumb, and like men amazed,
for the space of a quarter of an hour; in which time their countenances fell,
and they looked like another people, and quitted the places they had taken behind them,
and fell to plundering their chests and trunks.

But to return to our friend Robert Barrow,
who behaved himself under all those calamities in great patience,
and by faith overcame even the worst of men, looking to him who is invisible,
who by his grace supported him under all.
By prayer he wrestled with God, to be delivered from those unreasonable creatures,
desiring to lay his bones among his faithful friends in Philadelphia.
And God was so gracious that he sealed an assurance upon his spirit,
even before he was yet off his knees, that his prayer was heard,
and should be answered in due time.
And great strength and comfort he was to his companions in affliction.

When he arrived at Philadelphia, several friends went on board to help him on shore;
but he was so weak that he could not be removed that night,
being the 4th of the Second month,
but he signified to Friends his great satisfaction that the Lord had granted
his request that he might lay down his bones in that place;
that his heart was strong, and he hoped he might see Friends again at the meeting.
He made mention of the goodness of God to him,
and that his presence had attended him in all his exercise.
Next morning he was removed to the house of Samuel Carpenter,
where he slept a considerable time: the same day friends coming to visit him,
he rejoiced, putting forth his hand ready to embrace them, to whom he said,
'`Although my body be weak, my mind is sound and memory good;
and the Lord has been very good to me all along to this very day,
and this morning has sweetly refreshed me.`'
And farther added, '`The Lord has answered my desire, for I desired content,
and that I might come to this place to lay my bones among you.`'
Afterwards he said, '`It is a good thing to have a conscience void of offense,
both towards God and towards men.`'

On the day that he died, he desired a friend to write to his friends in England,
and to acquaint his relations that he had settled his affairs;
and afterwards declared to several friends that were by him, that the Lord was with him,
and all things were well, and that he had nothing to do but to die.
Accordingly, on the same day he departed this life in peace with God,
being the 4th of the Second month, in the year 1697; and was buried the 6th of the same,
in Friends`' burying-ground in Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania.

TUDOR BRIAN, of London, a youth about seventeen years of age,
was taken ill about the Tenth month, 1696, and from that time decayed daily,
falling into a deep consumption, till the Tenth month following.
Being in the country for his health,
he was often observed to be in retirement in the fields,
sometimes returning with wet eyes;
and his friends apprehending it might proceed from his distemper,
or else from fear of death, his frequent answers were, he was no ways afraid to die,
but willingly resigned himself to the will of God, either for life or death.
About a month before he died,
he was taken so ill as not to be able to go out of his chamber; and so continued,
being daily with a great sense of God upon his spirit;
and would often repeat a full assurance of his future happiness, saying, '`Come,
Lord Jesus, come quickly, and receive my soul.`'
A few days after, he called for a bible, desiring to read; his mother`'s answer was,
'`Child, you are weak;`' he said he could read; and so read the 17th chapter of John,
with trembling lips.
When he came to the 20th verse, "`Neither pray I for these alone,
but for them also which shall believe on me through
their word,`" he took particular notice,
and wept.

On the day before he departed, he fell so ill they thought he was smitten with death;
and several friends, as well then as before, visiting him,
he was much refreshed and comforted, and said, '`O mother,
how merciful is the great God to me,
that has put into the hearts of good friends to visit me!
There are healthier and younger lads than I, that are gone before me,
a poor consumptive lad; he has spared me; surely I shall never forget his mercies.`'
And to the Lord he said, '`Oh! glory, glory and praises, for they are yours forevermore.`'
Then sitting still, he said, '`Oh, you merciful God, you are merciful.
I can say that I have found it so; that when I had no breath, I have sought you,
and it has been given me.`'
His parents, hearing him, wept; but he answered, '`Wherefore are you troubled,
my dear parents?
Be not troubled for me, for I am going to a better place.
If it be the will of the Lord, he can raise me; but if not, his will be done:
it may be he may spare me two or three days.`'
Turning his eyes on his parents, he said, '`You are the nearest in the world to me,
but yet there is a nearer who is above.`'
After some silence he said,
'`I can say that in my younger years I have gone by myself down into the meadows,
and have cried to the Lord, but knew not where he was;
and when I heard his voice I trembled; and as I gave up,
the Lord Jesus made himself known to me.
Then I knew what I sought for:
with more concerning a vision he had of his future happiness;
and he testified against superfluity in the house.

About twelve hours before his death, a near relation desiring,
on behalf of those present, that they might be fitted for their latter end, he said,
'`You must pray, and hang and lean upon the Lord Jesus Christ: for it is of him,
and through him, that we must expect salvation.
Without him you can do nothing.
He died for sinners, and he is merciful to forgive, for he has forgiven me,
blessed be his holy name.
Although some be hardened and stubborn, yet the Lord is merciful; he can and may forgive;
but you that are in the truth, keep in the truth: with more which he said,
concerning remembering our Creator betimes, and concerning death.

About two hours before he died, he prayed thus: '`Lord God be merciful; you are good,
you are bountiful.
Lord have mercy on me!
Come, Lord Jesus, have mercy: you died for sinners; glory,
glory to the God of heaven! oh! praises to your name.
Lord Jesus receive my soul: with more that he said to his father and mother.
Lying still a little, he said,
'`O what a glorious kingdom I am going to! there are dainties enough.
Lord Jesus you have pardoned me.
O what a numerous army has my God!
He has a great one.`'
And so lay praising God till he finished this life, about two in the morning,
on the 3rd of the Tenth month, in the year 1697.

THOMAS HAINS, son of Thomas Hains and Hannah, his wife, of Southwark,
in the county of Surrey, was educated in the truth,
as professed by the people called Quakers, by his father;
and also for some time at the school of Richard Scoryer, of Wandsworth.
He was a dutiful child, and had a sense of the fear of God upon his heart,
so that during his sickness he behaved himself more like a man than an infant,
(as he called himself) having a care, lest he should say any word amiss.
If he refused to take any thing offered to him, and was again pressed to take it,
he replied, '`Would you have me tell a lie?`'
Once having refused something, he was desired to promise to take it in such a time;
his answer was '`Can I tell what is to come?`'
When he took that which he found refreshed him,
he with much thankfulness acknowledged it;
being also very sensible of the love and tender regard which his parents had towards him,
and expressed it several times to them.
He bore his sickness with much patience, and often expressed his willingness to die;
saying, '`It is better for me to die; this is a troublesome world;
and we should every day and every moment think upon the Lord.`'

A few days before his decease,
he uttered many expressions in prayer and praises to the Lord, saying,
'`You are a God of love, you are a God of mercy;
you know the hearts of them that love you; you know the hearts of them that seek you.
Lord remember your people.
You know the hearts of the ungodly; you know the hearts of the wicked;
you have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against you.`'
He also spoke of the care we ought to take of the never-dying soul,
and that the Lord will send forth his messengers.
Another time, expressing his inward satisfaction at a future state, he said, '`Glory,
glory; joy, joy: come mother, come father, come all; it is a brave place,
there are no tears nor sorrow:`' and praised God, saying,
'`You are worthy to have the honor and the glory forevermore; for to you it does belong.
You are God of heaven,
and of the whole earth;`' and continued about a quarter of an hour in prayer,
and said to the Lord, '`I am an infant, and cannot do anything without you.`'

One evening, several friends coming to visit him,
he desired their prayers to the Lord for him: and the next day himself prayed again,
saying, '`Our Father, who art in heaven,`'etc.
Afterwards he said, '`It is a brave thing to be at peace with the Lord.`'
His end drawing near, he said, '`Father, let me die.`'
And again called out '`Father, father.`'
His father being present, asked what he desired?
He said, '`I do not speak to you, but to my heavenly Father:
have mercy on me;`' and expressed much joy that he had with the Lord;
and desired them about him that he might be still; and so lay secretly praising the Lord.
A few hours before he died, he said, '`I come, Father, I come:`' and being very weak,
his voice was low, but he was heard to say, '`God is my father:`'
and so like a lamb he quietly finished his days the 12th of the Twelfth month,
in the year 1700, aged nine years.

END OF THE FIRST PART.
