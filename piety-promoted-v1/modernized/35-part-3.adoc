JOHN BOWRON, was born at Cotherstone in Yorkshire, near Barnard-Castle, in the year 1627,
which was the place of his outward habitation to his death.
He received the truth by the ministry of George Fox and James Nayler,
when they came into those parts; which was about the year 1653.
Soon after he went to Stratford steeple-house, and preached to the priest and people,
and from there to the cross, and at Barnard-Castle, and at Rumbel steeple-house,
and the people threw snow at him, as he stood upon a stone speaking to them.
Then he went to Bowes, and stood up in the steeple-house yard,
and spoke to the people there; and one of the men cried out to the people, '`Hang him,
hang him in the bell-house;`' and some time after, that man hanged himself.
After that he travelled into Allandale, and had a meeting there, and so to Scotland.
At Edinburgh he preached to the people as he went through the streets of that city,
and at the cross, and there were English soldiers who were kind to him;
and he travelled through that nation.
The soldiers were very kind to him, but the priests were in a rage against him,
for he was a dread to them.

About the year 1656 he took another journey to Scotland,
and at Birkwell he took shipping for Barbados, and was kindly received in that island,
and had many good meetings there;
and they would have had him tarry with them as long as he lived.
When his service was over in that island, he took shipping for Surinam,
and travelled upon the coasts of Guiana, a country of South America,
three or four hundred miles.
He went to their sort of worship, which was performed by beating upon hollow trees,
and making a great noise with skins, like a sort of drums;
and he declared the word of the Lord among them by an interpreter.
He travelled +++[+++among the Indian natives in several of their settlements],
and spoke to their kings,
who were arrayed with fish-shells hung about their necks and arms;
and they spoke to him in their language, and confessed he was a good man,
come from far to preach the white man`'s God.

After he had declared the name of the Lord in this barbarous country,
he returned with his interpreter back to Barbados again, and stayed a little time there,
visiting Friends; and a ship presenting, he embarked for England,
which proved a long perilous voyage of thirteen weeks.
After they had been at sea about six weeks, they met with a violent storm,
which took away their rigging, and their provisions grew scanty,
so that for five weeks they were reduced to a pint of water,
and a biscuit a day each man.
There were about sixty persons on board, and some died;
but at length they arrived at Dover, where he took passage by land for London,
and met with George Fox, and Francis Howgill, to whom he gave an account of his voyage.
This was about the time that Richard Cromwell was made protector of England,
to whom he went with a message from the Lord, and warned him of the day of the Lord.

After John Bowron returned home into Yorkshire, and rested a little time,
he took his journey into Scotland again, and so into Ireland,
traveling through all that nation from sea to sea, and returned back again;
and so continued visiting that nation of Ireland six times in six years.
He was several times in prison for the testimony of truth; as at Durham jail,
and at Richmond house of correction twenty weeks in a sharp winter;
and for being at a meeting at Croft-bridge, they took from him a horse and two steers,
and imprisoned him again in Durham jail;
afterwards he was released by the bishop of Durham.

He oftentimes travelled to London in company with John Langstaff, and to Bristol,
and the west of England, till of latter years hindered by age and bodily infirmity.
After many journeys, and sore travail and labor, the Lord gave him this blessing,
that he lived to be full of days, and died in peace in the same house where he was born.
About two weeks before his death he rode to the meeting as he used to do,
and bore his testimony among Friends; and two or three days after,
went to the burial of an ancient Friend; and his grandchild waited upon him,
where he spoke at the graveyard a pretty while.

The first-day after, finding his strength decay, he desired his son, Henry Bowron,
to go to the meeting, and acquaint Friends that his days were almost spent,
and he knew not that he should come any more among them;
and his son answered his desire, and many Friends came to see him.
Two days after, he arose without help, and came cheerfully forth of his chamber,
desiring his son to trim him, which he did; after, he took his grandchildren by the hand,
saying, '`Stay with me, go not away, for I am taking my journey to a city, New Jerusalem,
that needs not the light of the sun, nor the light of the moon,
for the Lord God and the Lamb is the light thereof.`'
He added, '`Zion is a precious habitation:
he that dwells within the gates of Zion shall never be in need.`'
Again, '`What can be expected?
I have seen many good days.
I have seen the wonders of God both by sea and land.
The sea saw the wonders of God, and fled, and Jordan was driven back.`'

Sometimes he would pray to the Lord, saying, '`Lord bless this nation,
and the city of London, which I dearly love.`'
The night before he died, Thomas Raylton came to visit him, and being told who it was,
he said, '`Thomas, pray with me,`' and he did so,
and the presence of God was felt among them, and praises were given to the Lord.
Though he was weak in body, yet strong in the inward man,
and expressed his satisfaction with that opportunity.
After, he said, '`Thomas, what meeting had you yesterday?`'
meaning the quarterly-meeting; he answered they had a good meeting, of which he was glad;
further he inquired, '`What way are you going?`'
Thomas told him southward; he said, '`Tell friends of London how I am,
and mind to give my love to them and to G. Whitehead;`' and in great sweetness of spirit,
and peace of soul, he continued till about midnight, sensible to the last.

He died the 5th day of the Eighth month, 1704, aged seventy-seven years;
a minister fifty-one years.

HUGH ROBERTS, late of Pennsylvania, formerly of Wales,
was a man fitted and qualified by God`'s power to be a serviceable
minister of the gospel to the church of Christ in America,
in which country he lived about eighteen years.
His company was very desirable, being greatly edifying;
he had passed through many trials and exercises,
so could by experience speak a word in season to the travailing and weary soul.
His doctrine in the meetings of God`'s people dropped as dew,
and his speech as small rain upon the tender plants; for in the openings of life,
things both new and old came forth of the treasury of wisdom.
His testimony was comfortable to the hearts of the people, in the sense of God`'s love,
who is the author of all good to his people; a man zealous for good order in the church,
and skillful to accommodate differences when they happened.
He travelled in the work of the gospel in Maryland, Long Island, Rhode Island,
and New England, where his service was effectual to the people,
and to himself a great satisfaction.

At his return homewards, being weakly of body, having been much spent,
he lay sick at the house of John Rodman in Long Island,
where his friend John Bevan visiting him, he said,
'`Nothing lies in my way as an obstruction to hinder my peace with God.`'
After that he got home to Pennsylvania.
A friend of his taking his farewell of him, said to him,
'`I believe your deep trials and exercises are nearly at an end,
and that peace and joy everlasting will be your portion from the Lord for your faithfulness.`'
In much brokenness of heart, and sense of the presence of God upon his spirit,
he answered the friend after this manner, '`I am satisfied thereof,
and can bless my God for it.`'

He departed this life the 18th of the Sixth month, 1702,
and his body was buried at Merion the 20th of the same.

PRISCILLA COTTON, formerly wife of Arthur Cotton,
who then dwelt at Plymouth in Devonshire, now of Colchester in Essex,
was one of the first that received Friends in Plymouth; namely,
John Audland and Thomas Arey, in 1654.
She lived an honorable life, and was valiant for truth,
and often bore public testimony to it in steeple-houses, and other places,
against the priests and professors, who walked out of the truth;
and for her testimony she suffered several imprisonments and cruel dealings from them,
and other instruments employed by them.
She travelled in several places, bearing testimony for truth in the living power of God.
She also in her life-time gave forth several good papers, which are printed; and lastly,
the day she died, she left a paper for Friends,
as a testimony of her good will and love to them all; which is as follows.

[.blurb]
=== The Testimony of Priscilla Cotton, to Friends, the day she died.

All my dear friends, who have found your Redeemer, oh! wait upon him at all times,
that you may stand continually in his presence where life is,
that with the light you receive from him, you may see your thoughts, and deny them,
that in stayedness you may be kept, when the hasty forward spirit would arise,
and keep it down.
With the measure of God`'s spirit all may be weighed, the words to what they tend,
that no lightness may appear in your words, nor unsavoriness, that no offense come,
but edification by all you speak.
Let the elders watch, that at no time the younger may see lightness, laughter,
or words of offense, but that you may always keep down the evil in yourselves,
and may minister grace to all you have to do withal, that God`'s spirit be not grieved.
So keep the field clean, that was once plowed up and made green and beautiful,
that no stones or hurtful weeds grow in it to oppress the Seed.

Friends, the cross is the power of God; when you flee the cross, you lose the power;
that which pleases self, is above the cross, and that which pleases man,
is above the cross; and that which shuns the cross, yields to the carnal part,
and loses its dominion.
Though the cross seems foolishness, stand in it; though it seems weak, stand in it;
though it be a stumbling-block to the wise, stand in it; there the dominion, authority,
and crown are received.
This is not for you to be exercised in for a time only, as at your first convincement,
but daily, even to the death, as long as a desire, will or thought remains in you,
contrary to God`'s pure light, and judge it by it; and as you wait in the light,
you will come to know a cross in the use of meat, drink, and apparel,
and keep to the cross when alone, or in company;
what the pure mind of God stands against in you, that the cross is against.

So friends, watch daily to keep Christ`'s command,
'`Take up your daily cross;`' be not at liberty one day, but deny your own will,
your own thoughts, and your own self.
Taking up the cross, you feel the power, the strength of the Lord God,
which breaks down all, keeps in order, in safety, and in peace.
This preserves from stubbornness, willfulness, and headiness,
and brings all to be subject, as dear children, unto God,
and subject one unto another as brethren.
In the light and in the cross there are no evil thoughts, no hard speeches,
no contention, no loving preeminence; but as brethren and sisters, pitiful,
tenderhearted, courteous, forgiving, forbearing, long-suffering,
and supporting one another.
Here the power of the cross is known, which brings all to God`'s praise,
and to his honor and glory, and to his children`'s prosperity and peace: so let it be.
Amen.

After this, seeing her departure was nigh at hand,
she desired several Friends to be called; being come,
she desired to be lifted up in her bed;
and in a sense of life she spoke suitably to every one for some time,
exhorting Friends to peace and unity, and to keep in the cross,
which is the power of God, that all might witness a mortification to sin,
and a renewedness to life,
that the living God and his holy truth might be honored by all;
and that Friends might keep out of the fashions and customs of the world,
both in words and apparel, every one answering the truth therein.

After this she called for her husband, who was at that time weak; embracing him,
she said, '`My dear husband, the Lord has largely manifested his love to us,
and large has been our experience thereof, ever since he brought us together to this day.
And now, my dear, the Lord will separate us, but grieve not;
let your eye and expectation be to him,
and the Lord who has hitherto helped us will be your help and support;
in whom let your trust be forever!`'

In like manner she called for her daughter,
and gave her charge to live in subjection to God`'s truth,
and to forsake what she was convinced to be sin and evil, saying if she feared the Lord,
and walked in his truth, it should be well with her; but if not, you will be miserable.
She also spoke to other friends and relations, which for brevity is omitted.
Afterwards she said,
'`Let me lie down that I may die;`' so in great stillness
and quietness she departed this life,
about four hours after she had spoken these words, the 4th day of the Sixth month, 1664.

ANDREW GRAHAM, of Cumberland, near the borders of Scotland,
was a man of large understanding, a loving temper, and willing to do good unto all,
which increased his esteem with all sorts of people.
When the Lord was pleased to send his servants called
Quakers to preach the gospel in the borders of England,
in Cumberland, he with many hundreds came to hear their testimony,
and did confess unto the truth.
But he was before closely joined in fellowship with a people of good repute in the country,
and it was hard for him to leave them, which occasioned his halting as between two,
some considerable time, until the Lord was pleased to renew his visitation to him,
and by his righteous judgments awakened him to a true sense of his state;
so that he was deprived of peace,
until he gave up to be faithful to what the Lord
by his spirit discovered to him to be his duty.

He joined with the people called Quakers from that time,
and was a good example in conduct among men, in humility, and in self-denial,
and in suffering;
and in about two years time the Lord committed to him a part of the ministry,
and he faithfully labored in the work of the gospel, in the churches of Christ,
both in some parts of England, and in Scotland.
His service was great in the meeting to which he more peculiarly belonged;
and the more for his innocency, true zeal, and being devoted to the service of the truth,
laboring to bring people to the life and power of godliness.
He was as a nursing father,
or cherisher of those in whose hearts he saw God had begun his work,
as well as he was terrible against ungodliness.

He was suddenly seized with a great sickness, and lay sick but a short time;
in which he said, '`I see they are happy who, when death comes,
have nothing to do but to die;
for the pains of the body at this time are enough to struggle with.`'
As he lived, so he died, ending his days in a travail of spirit,
that Friends might be faithful; and Friends visiting him,
the Lord`'s power and presence was plentifully enjoyed,
to the tendering of the hearts of many.
He finished his course in this life on the 15th of the Eleventh month, 1704.
Aged sixty-two years.

THOMAS WRESLE, of Winteringham, in the county of Lincoln,
was an early seeker of truth and righteousness;
and for some time had fellowship among the Baptists.
He received the truth in the year 1655, wherein he much improved,
and approved himself a faithful man, loving truth, and the friends thereof,
with all his heart, and serving it and them faithfully to the end of his days.
He was exemplary in his conduct, and helpful to his neighbors;
and having a good understanding, was able to give counsel and advice,
which was esteemed among them.
In his sickness he said, '`I have seen where the weary are at rest,
and where the wicked cease from troubling;
and I have received an earnest of that blessed inheritance,
which is laid up in store for all the faithful.`'

A day or two before he died, some of his friends visited him,
which greatly comforted him, as he signified; to whom he said,
'`I have loved truth with all my heart, and all the friends of it, and feel nothing,
but that all is well with me.`'
In and with much fervency, he said,
'`I desire that Friends would keep up their meetings
in the name and power of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and that the Lord may bless and prosper them.`'
He exhorted Friends to keep their ancient zeal, love, and integrity,
which the Lord raised in them in the beginning, saying,
'`That is my great comfort now upon my dying bed;`' and taking his leave of Friends, said,
'`It is life, it is life, Friends, that overcomes death.
Give my dear love to all faithful Friends everywhere;`' and life
and truth was felt to flow among them at that time.

He died the 21st of the Twelfth month, 1704

WILLIAM CAPTAIN came out of England with his parents into Ireland, after the civil wars;
and was convinced at Mountmellick meeting.
He was bred a scholar, and in his youth intended for a priest.
He was a faithful, patient, and deep sufferer for the testimony of a good conscience,
and often in prison for meeting to worship God, and for tithes;
holding forth good conduct, as became the gospel.

In the time of his sickness, some Friends being present, he said to them as follows;
'`The Lord has appeared to me in a wonderful manner,
when I was ready to sink under great affliction; then did he take me by the hand,
as he did Israel of old, and raised me over my afflictions.
Whereas I had need of a physician, the Lord was unto me instead of a physician;
and when I had need of patience, he gave me patience; and when I had need of sleep,
he accompanied me with his living presence from time to time;
whereby my soul was sweetly consoled, so that I can say with the Psalmist,
"`It is good for me that I was afflicted;`" and with Simeon,
that "`My eyes have seen his salvation;`" and with Job, that "`My Redeemer lives,
and my eyes have seen him.`"
See how good the Lord is.
Oh! my soul, praise you the Lord, let all that is within me praise the Lord.`'
Another time he said, '`The truth which the Quakers profess is the way to salvation,
and there is no other way.`'

He died a prisoner for the testimony to truth, the 30th day of the Ninth month, 1672.

ROGER GILL, of London, shoe-maker, received the blessed truth,
as professed by the people called Quakers, about the year 1683.
He formerly went among those called Baptists,
and I have heard him say that before he received
truth he was guilty of many gross and enormous crimes.
But by the power and virtue of the spirit of God, he came to know his heart changed,
and being washed and sanctified, and the fear of God placed therein,
which preserved him from those vices he had formerly been addicted to,
for which he was very thankful to the Lord.
Some years before he died,
God gave him a dispensation of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to preach,
and he was faithful and diligent in that service, and was an able minister,
having a word in season to speak to the weary soul;
and very zealous he was for the prosperity of the truth.

In the year 1699 he had a concern upon his mind to visit the brethren in America,
and to preach the gospel to the people on that continent.
He went over the sea for that purpose, in company with his friend Thomas Story,
concerned in the same work; where they had not travelled long,
before they heard the people in Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania,
were visited with a malignant distemper, which caused great mortality.
At hearing thereof Roger Gill said he felt a great weight and exercise to come upon him,
so that he had no ease in his spirit till he came among them at Philadelphia.
The sickness increasing, he visited the sick, and preached in their public meetings,
saying that when he was one hundred miles off them,
his love in the Lord was such to them, that had he wings he would fly into Philadelphia.

It was the time of their yearly-meeting while he was there; where he, with others,
was concerned in public, earnestly to supplicate the Lord for the people;
and particularly Roger Gill fervently and devoutly interceded the Lord to stay his hand,
and if he would please to accept of his life for a sacrifice,
he did freely offer up his life to the Lord for the people.
When meeting was over he often expressed the ease of his mind,
and that it was with him that he had not much to do but visit Friends of Burlington,
in West Jersey, about twenty miles off.
He accomplished that journey;
and at his return to Philadelphia was taken sick with the distemper,
which filled him with great pain and affliction of body,
and he remembered in his sickness the free-will-offering up of himself unto the Lord;
saying to Friends about him, '`It is not in my heart to repent of the offer I have made.`'

He was cheerful, notwithstanding his great affliction of body;
and exhorted Friends to faithfulness, and said,
'`The Lord has sanctified my afflictions to me, and has made my sickness as a bed of down:`'
and when some did speak of their hope of his recovery, he said in much love,
'`Truly I have neither thoughts nor hopes about being raised in this life;
but I know I shall rise sooner than many imagine,
and receive a reward according to my works.`'
His sickness continued seven days upon him;
and a few hours before his death he took his leave and said, '`Farewell, farewell,
farewell forever,`'
and sweetly passed away out of this life on the 2nd day of the Eighth month, 1699.
It was observed that the sickness stopped, and very few were buried of it after him.

He left a widow and two sons behind him in England.
He was aged about thirty-four years.

WILLIAM SMITH, of Elsham, in the county of Lincoln, was an elder in the truth,
having received it in the love of it, and walked faithfully therein to the end,
and was a preacher of righteousness; in conduct a man of sincerity and godly simplicity,
giving no occasion of offense to Jew or Gentile, neither to the church of Christ,
and much beloved by friends and neighbors.
When on his dying bed, several Friends visiting him,
found him in a heavenly frame of mind.
He being told Friends`' love was to him, he answered, '`I have friends on earth,
and friends in heaven, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
whom I have true fellowship withal, though yet in this earthly tabernacle;
my treasure being in heaven, my heart is there also, where the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit dwells.`'
As he lived, so he died in the Lord, and is blessed, for so says the spirit,
and he is at rest from his labors.

He departed this life the 17th of the Twelfth month, 1701.
Aged seventy-nine years.

MARGARET THOMPSON, wife of John Thompson, near Mountmellick, in Ireland, being
upon her deathbed, and a few days before she died, calling her children to her,
said unto them, '`Fear the Lord, and abide in the fear of the Lord.
I do not allow you any thing further, than as you abide in the truth,
and love one another.`'
After that she said, '`The Lord helps me, and I find all temptations taken away.`'
Another time she said, '`They that die in the Lord,
have unity one with another;`' and she confessed the love of God, and said,
'`I will lean upon my beloved;`' and further said to Friends present,
'`Dear brethren and sisters, I exhort you in the Lord to love one another,
and walk in God`'s truth forever.
Women Friends, I exhort you all in the love of God, govern well in your own houses,
or else you cannot govern well in the church of Christ.
Likewise, young women, be sober-minded, and fear the Lord, and be charitable,
and walk in love to the end.
Dear friends, I salute you all in the Lord;
and I here give in my testimony against paying of tithes, for I never paid any tithes,
nor ever condescended to the paying of any, this being my last testimony.`'
She also exhorted Friends to their first love, which they had received in the beginning,
bearing her testimony against the vain fashions of the world.
She died the 5th of the Third month, 1688.

WILLIAM GIBSON, born in Caton, near Lancaster, about the year 1629,
being a soldier in the garrison in Carlisle, Cumberland, and he, with three others,
understanding that a preacher called a Quaker, who was a stranger,
had appointed a meeting in that city, agreed to go together to the meeting,
with an intent to abuse the said Friend, whose name was Thomas Holmes.
William coming first to the meeting,
and hearing the Friend powerfully declaring the truth,
was so affected and reached by his testimony, that he stepped up into the meeting,
near the place where Thomas Holmes stood, and knowing the design of his fellows,
waited to defend the Friend +++[+++against]
any that dared offer to abuse him.
From this time he became a constant frequenter of Friends`' meetings,
and quitted his place in the garrison, and employed himself in the trade of shoemaking,
and waited upon God in silence, under the exercise of his power,
for the space of three years.
Afterwards he received a dispensation of the gospel to preach,
and became very serviceable in several places of the county of Lancaster.

On the 22nd day of the Sixth month, 1662, he married Elizabeth Thompson,
daughter of William Thompson, of Crossmore, in Lancashire, and settled in Sankey meeting,
near Warrington, for some years; and some were convinced of truth by his ministry,
who continue faithful to this day, and many others confirmed in the blessed truth;
so that his memorial is of good savor in those parts.
He afterwards travelled southwards in the work of the gospel,
and was imprisoned at Maidstone, in Kent, for his testimony, which imprisonment was long;
from which being discharged, he went to London, and removed his wife and family there,
where his service was well known to Friends in that city,
and many other parts of the nation, and many are the seals of his ministry.
Though he was severe in reproof,
and terrible in his ministry to the hypocrite and the workers of iniquity,
yet he was as a tender father to the mourners in Zion, and divided the word aright,
speaking a word in season to the tempted, afflicted, and travailing soul;
a cherisher of such as loved and feared the Lord;
and oftentimes his ministry was to the refreshment of the weary,
and the overflowings of his cup administered true comfort and consolation to the thirsty,
panting souls.

He was a lover of unity among brethren, but as a sword against that spirit, which,
under pretense of love to the light of Christ Jesus in their consciences,
would plead for a liberty that was out of the truth,
and sought to draw others from the footsteps of the flock of Christ:
to which purpose he wrote a book, entitled, '`An Epistle of Love.`'
He was a man devoted to the service of God, and was an example to believers,
even in word, in conduct, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity,
and gave attendance to reading, and to exhortation, and to doctrine,
given to hospitality, and apt to teach, and was approved as a minister of God.
He had suffered hard imprisonments, and the spoiling of his goods,
for his testimony`'s sake against hireling priests, who feed themselves and not the flock,
and against their maintenance by tithes.

In the Third month, 1684, he travelled into his native country, Lancashire,
though he had been out of health;
and in his return home was taken sick of an ague and fever at Coventry,
yet got to London, and continued ill for three months.
On his sick-bed he exhorted Friends who came to visit him, to faithfulness,
and trust and confidence in the Lord, and to the love of the brethren;
and testified against that spirit which leads out of unity into a self-separation.

He left two sons and one daughter,
to whom he gave good advice in the time of his sickness,
directing them to that blessed and divine light of Christ, which he had preached,
and by which he had received the knowledge of God, and by walking in it,
salvation to his soul; desiring that they might know the same, and walk in it.
'`It will show you,`' said he, '`what is good, and what is evil: refrain from evil,
and do the good; take heed to God`'s word in your hearts,
so you will know your ways cleansed by it.`'
He charged them to avoid all vain and idle company,
and to be diligent in frequenting assemblies of the Lord`'s people,
and to have an ear open to receive the good counsel and advice of them who fear the Lord,
and are faithful to him, and to keep society with such, and to flee youthful lusts,
which war against the soul.
Moreover he said, '`Love the righteous judgments of the Lord,
and have regard to the fear of God, and love humility;
so shall you receive wisdom and understanding.
Be obedient to your mother, and be tender over her; and be not conceited,
nor high-minded.`'
He also charged them to read the Scripture, and other good books.

Thus did this good man, like Abraham, charge his children to walk before the Lord.
He was very resigned, and given up to die, and expressed his love to the brethren,
saying, '`My love in the Lord Jesus is to all the faithful.
Remember my dear love to them, and to all the faithful laborers.`'
Not long before he died, John Field visiting him, he looked earnestly on him;
his wife asking if he knew him, he answered '`No;`' she told him; he replied,
'`He is the first man I did not know.`'
At this time he seemed very retired in his mind unto the Lord, his rock, and his refuge;
several times lifting up his hands, and showed a willingness to be turned, and then said,
'`I have spoken my mind while I could speak, and now I cannot.`'

He died the 20th of the Ninth month, 1684, about five in the afternoon,
and was honorably buried at Friends`' burying ground, in Bunhill-fields,
many hundreds of friends and brethren accompanying his corpse to the grave.
Aged fifty-five years, a minister twenty-six years.

ELEANOR BARCROFT, daughter of William Barcroft, near Edenderry, in King`'s County,
Ireland, was a young woman of a clean and innocent conduct,
obedient to her parents and loving to all, but especially to the godly,
whose company was her delight; and as her life was good, so was her death.
In the time of her sickness, she desired to have the tenth chapter of Luke read,
wherein two passages were remarkable to her;
the one of the man inquiring who was his neighbor, the other of Martha and Mary;
at the reading of which she was much refreshed.

The morning before she died, it was observed she prayed with a low voice,
and did wrestle in spirit with the Lord; and in the afternoon the Lord did so appear,
that the pangs of death were as it were taken away,
so that she sung hymns and spiritual songs of praise to Christ her Redeemer;
and afterwards said, '`Oh! that I might live with you forever, and forevermore.`'
Then she took leave of her parents and relations.
Being asked how she did, she answered,
'`I feel neither pain nor trouble;`' and hearing her mother weep, said,
'`Why does my mother weep, for I am well.`'
With these and some other words which cannot be well remembered,
because of the sorrow of those about her,
she departed this life with the seal of assurance in the true faith,
and is gone to her rest, and has left a good memorial behind her.

She died the 27th of the Eighth month, 1678, in the nineteenth year of her age.

I have known the terrors of the Lord for sin,
and for transgression committed against him in the time of my youth.
But he that is an everlasting fountain of life and mercy,
did not leave me in the greatness of my wickedness,
but in the abundance of his pity and compassion visited me, and found me out,
and laid hold on me by his judgments, and did awaken me,
even in that dead state and condition he found me in.
He made manifest his living truth, that is, Christ Jesus, the light of the world,
which enlightens every one that comes into the world, of the whole stock of mankind.
So the light and life being made manifest to me, it became the joy of my heart,
and the life of my soul.
I was brought to see that I must come to deny the world,
and the glory and riches thereof, and the honor thereof, and all things that are beneath.
It became a very great cross to the fleshly part, which I saw I must daily keep to;
for when I went from that which crucified me to the world, and the world to me,
my enemy prevailed over me; so that I saw the words of Christ fulfilled in me,
in that respect, according to his testimony, who declared in this way;
"`Whosoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be made my disciple.`'
When I came to see that heavenly treasure, made manifest, and revealed in my soul,
and kept my affections thereunto,
the yoke of Christ which seemed to be so heavy became light;
even so it is unto all them that keep in faithful obedience unto him,
and take up his daily cross.
I have known a travel towards that spiritual kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ;
for I saw a race set before me, and I saw, if I did run with all my might,
it was possible for me to obtain the prize.
Therein I have had an exercise of my faith;
for had I not believed in the object of my faith, Christ Jesus,
it had been impossible for me to run that blessed race.
As I was faithful and obedient to the manifestation of Christ,
who is God`'s righteousness, which is manifest and received in the internal parts,
I received daily supplies of strength in my greatest exercises.
Unto whom then shall I return the glory and the praise
of this wonderful work of my salvation,
and eternal happiness, but unto Christ Jesus, the great fountain of life, mercy,
and truth, and righteousness! which I do desire to return at this time,
and at all other times, unto him who lives and reigns forever, God over all,
blessed forevermore.

And now, my friends, as the Lord brought these things unto my remembrance,
I could do no less than declare unto you the wonderful dealings of the Lord to my soul,
that all thereby might receive the instructions of the Lord,
who is forewarning the sons and daughters of men,
according to the greatness of his wisdom.
Certainly, although the Lord never created man to destroy him,
yet his determination shall stand forever; that is,
they that take warning in the day of their visitation, and return with all their hearts,
and with all their souls, shall find the way of life made manifest, and revealed in them,
which leads unto the Father, who is an eternal fountain of life.
But they that neglect the day of their visitation, must he shut up under darkness,
until the great day of the Lord.
And then they shall come to know they have rebelled against him,
and must know his righteous judgments, although it be to their everlasting destruction.
Here they shall see and know that their destruction was and is of themselves;
and God will be glorified, even in the destruction of his enemies.

And now it is the desire of my heart and soul, even before the Lord God Almighty,
that all may be warned and awakened out of that state of deadness
and security which the god of this world has brought them into,
so that the righteous judgments of the Lord might be made manifest unto them;
that so they may lay hold of his mercy in the day of their visitation.
And as for my dear friends,
who have known the gathering arm of his power into the holy habitation of our God,
which is Jerusalem, which is from above, the mother of us all,
I warn you all in the fear of the Lord to be careful to keep your habitation,
for in that consists your safety.

While Israel kept the place wherein God ordained them to be outwardly,
Balaam could not curse them, nor could any enchantment be found to prevail against them;
but when the wiles of their adversaries enticed them out of their habitations,
how many thousands were destroyed thereby!
The enemy stands without this holy habitation of the people of the Lord,
to entice his people to mix with a wrong seed,
and then we give our strength to our enemies,
and so befool away that heavenly treasure which God has committed to our charge.
Notwithstanding the enemy has prevailed over many upon this account,
yet I have taken notice of the goodness of this heavenly shepherd,
and great bishop of our souls, who has sought after them also,
that have been scattered out of the fold by that means.
Many he has laid hold on by the crook of his judgments,
and brought them back to the fold again.
And behold how many have perished, to the grief of the shepherd, and of the flock also.
But oh! forever blessed and praised be the Lord,
that has kept and preserved a remnant that have faithfully followed him,
who are built upon the rock Christ Jesus, where they stand steadfastly,
showing forth the greatness of his love.
They are as a city on a hill, that are seen far and near,
and are become the light of the dark world, by the shining of their holy lives;
and so shining by reflection, receiving their light continually from Christ Jesus,
the true light of the world.
Blessed are all they who know the gathering into this blessed city,
and abide steadfast unto the end; for the Lord has chosen Mount Zion unto himself,
that from there his glory might be proclaimed throughout all generations.

And now, my dearly beloved friends, whom I dearly salute,
even in the bowels of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ;
oh! my love unto you all is beyond expression,
who have kept in faithful obedience to the truth.
Oh! the blessed satisfaction that we have found in him,
when we have been gathered into his name, and there drank together in one spirit,
so that our souls have been exceedingly refreshed,
and we have been made partakers of the heavenly bread,
which has been broken plentifully unto us, even at the table of the Lord.
Oh! never forget those blessed opportunities; but as you are kept in spiritual health,
you will feel a hungering after the bread of life, day after day,
and a thirsting after the water of life also.
So being kept here, you are capable of the blessing of the Lord,
and will see the-Scripture fulfilled in yourselves, which says,
"`Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness,
for they shall be satisfied.`"

About eight hours after he had delivered this to Friends present,
he died in peace the 22nd of the Third month, 1682.

JAMES BLACKHOUSE, of Yelland Conyers, in the county of Lancaster,
was born of believing parents, called Quakers, in the year 1668,
and when he grew up he received the same faith,
and for several years professed truth in much sincerity and plainness.
He was a man of a blameless conduct, and a good example,
and of great service in several affairs of truth, until, in the year 1697, he was,
at the suit of the dean and chapter of Worcester,
apprehended and committed to Lancaster castle for his Christian testimony against tithes.
Here he continued for some time a faithful sufferer, until he fell sick of body,
which increased upon him to the finishing of his life in this world.

When he was, as to outward appearance, nigh unto death, the Lord revived his spirit,
and he sang, and made pleasant melody unto God in his heart; and said,
'`The Lord has appeared in a wonderful manner unto my soul,
and has removed and taken away the pains of this my outward body,
and has received me into his bosom, and has set me upon his holy mountain,
which is as sure as Mount Zion, that cannot be moved,
and it is better for me to die than to live.`'

He died, a faithful sufferer for the testimony of Jesus Christ, in Lancaster castle,
the 13th day of the Fourth month, 1697.
Aged twenty-nine years.

MERCY JOHNSON, wife of Elihu Johnson, of Manchester, and daughter of Samuel Watson,
of Stanforth, in the county of York, was born the 7th day of the Fifth month, 1670.
She received a gift of the ministry while unmarried;
and in the year 1697 travelled with Jennet Stow in the work
of the gospel into the western and southern parts of England,
and in some part of Wales.
In the year 1699 she went, with her father, Samuel Watson, into Scotland,
to visit the meetings of Friends in that nation.
She was a tender woman, of a weakly constitution of body, though many times,
when in the Lord`'s service, she seemed very strong,
and was concerned in her spirit for good of all, and for the prosperity of truth,
and desired no long life in this world.

In the beginning of her illness she often desired of the Lord to give
her patience to undergo what might be allowed to come upon her.
Her illness abated, but in some time came again violently upon her;
also she was sensible her end drew near,
and often desired it in the time of her sickness.
The Lord favored her with his presence, and made her sick bed pleasant to her,
insomuch that she sang praises to the Lord, the giver of all good things.
Many Friends visited her in her sickness,
and it was a comfort to them and her relations to feel the Lord`'s presence with her;
and she declared of the goodness of God,
and how well content she was to be taken off the stage of this world, saying,
'`I am not in love with it.`'

Many were her excellent sayings, which are not remembered.
Near her latter end she was more filled with God`'s salvation,
and some of her words were as follow; some Friends being present,
'`Happy are you whose kingdom is not of this world, but of the Father`'s;
the Father`'s kingdom, your kingdom Friends, love God better than all.
Be faithful to the Lord every one, although you are but few.
I could have been glad that the whole meeting had been here;
surely they will remember what I said the last meeting I opened my mouth among them;
that was, to prize their precious time, not knowing how long they might have time,
neither what exercises they have yet to meet withal.
Now the time draws near that I shall go to an everlasting kingdom, where all sorrow,
tears and sighing shall be done away.
Glory, glory in the highest, to the Lord my God, who has been with me,
and borne up my head in time of great exercises.
I have nothing to do but to die.
Keep you near to the Lord,
that so when you come to lay down your heads you may have nothing to do but die.`'

Speaking to her husband, she said, '`Oh! my dear,
I have in the time of my health desired to live with the Lord, and to be faithful to him,
and now I see I have nothing to spare;
what will become of those who live a careless life,
and do not make a right use of their precious time?`'
She was, in the time of her speaking these words, filled with the love of God,
and the sweet spirit of life did attend her, to the comfort of those present;
and she said, '`This outward body grows weaker and weaker,
yet blessed and praised be the Lord, my inward man grows stronger and stronger.`'
In time of silence she made songs of melody to God in her heart;
and after a Friend prayed by her, she said, '`am so filled with God`'s love,
I shall never be emptied again.`'
She much longed to go out of this world,
waiting for the coming of the Lord to remove her, and said, '`My dear children,
I have prayed for them who are near and dear to me; but now I can leave them freely,
and commit them into the hand of my God.`'

Speaking to her husband and them, she said, '`I must part with all,
and I will bid you all farewell; the Lord bless you all, and keep you all,
in all your exercises that will come upon you.
I believe the Lord will be with you, as you have an eye to him.`'
Another time she said, '`Have nothing to do with them of ill spirits, but keep to God,
and he will give you power over them.`'
She was much grieved to see any professing truth to be light and airy,
out of the savor of it, and said, '`A day of trial will come upon them.
Another time, being in a quiet frame of mind, she said,
'`The sooner a period is put to this life,
the sooner I shall go to my everlasting comfort.`'
One wishing her a good night, she said, '`I shall have a good night,
let it be how it will; blessed and praised be the name of the Lord,
I am full of his goodness.
What a great difference between being thus, and in some of my sick fits!
There is a great comfort in one, but not in the other;
only that I think that it is doing the work, and hastening me to my everlasting joy.`'

A little before she was taken away, having got some rest in sleep, when she was awakened,
said, '`Now I am very sensible I must go soon to my joy,
that will last forever;`' and speaking to her husband, said, '`Fare you well, my dear,
now I shall be well in a little time.`'
She lay still a little while again, then said to those present,
'`Oh! the Lord is the best master you can serve while you live,
for he will reward you in your afflictions as he rewards me.
Oh! he is a fountain set open for me in a full manner in my affliction.
Glory, glory, praises, praises to his eternal name.
I will praise him while I have breath in my nostrils; he has been a merciful God to me,
and has helped me over many things, and has blotted out my sins,
and will remember them no more.
Oh! praise, honor, and glory to him forevermore.
Now into your hand I commit my dear husband and children, whom you have bestowed upon me,
and will take me from them; bless and preserve them to the end.`'

Thus she was drawn forth to supplicate the Lord for all, saying, '`I love all,
and God above all, for what he has done for me.`'
After this, she asked what hour it was; they told her four in the morning; she said,
'`I shall surely be gone in a few hours to my everlasting rest;`'
desiring her dear love might be remembered to all Friends in general.
Then she lay down quietly, waiting for her change, and desired all might be still,
and none come to disturb her in her passing away; after she awaked, she said,
'`Let us praise the Lord once more; we will love him above all.
All glory, praise, and eternal renown to his most worthy name; he has filled my heart,
and is near to crown my soul.
I would not live if I might choose to have the whole world.
Oh! you, the Lord, are better than all; my soul magnifies you; honor, glory,
and eternal praises be given to you forever, and forevermore;
I will praise you to the end.
Lord be with my dear husband and children to the end.`'
She said, '`I hope you will remember me when I am gone, to the comfort of your souls.`'
She said to her husband, '`The Lord united us in his own love together,
and in his love he will part us.
I was always satisfied before and since, that the Lord`'s hand brought us together.`'

The First-day of the week several friends came to visit her,
whom she exhorted to be faithful to what God had made known to them;
and her words had power with them, to the tendering the hearts of them she spoke to.
A little before her departure, she had a mind to send for her father to her burial,
who was an ancient man, about eighty years of age, and dwelt forty miles off.
He coming, she was glad,
and told him how good God had been unto her in the time of her sickness, and said,
'`If it was not for the hope of glory which is to come, I had fainted.`'
After this, she said, '`Now, Lord, when you please, remove me;
I am content with your will, when you see fit.`'

She continued in a heavenly frame of mind;
and a young woman who used to go to meeting coming to see her, she gave her good advice;
and afterwards fell asleep.
When she awoke, her husband asked her if she would drink any thing; she said,
'`I have had a full draught of the goodness of my God;
I did not so much as think of cordials;`' and so continued
praising the Lord for his goodness,
and the enjoyment of his presence.
She said, '`My troubles in a little time will be over,
and I shall be at rest and peace with my God,
where I shall praise him forever;`' and she said,
'`I think in a vision I have seen my dear mother and sisters, in shining garments,
where I shall be soon.
He is a great and mighty king that I am going to.
Oh! love so, that you that stay a little behind may come after.`'
A little before she died her husband asked her how she did, and she said, '`Come near,
'`and she kissed him, and bade him farewell; and presently again she said,
'`Let us bid farewell again;`' and so died, as if she had fallen asleep,
about the tenth hour at night, the 14th of the Twelfth month, 1704,
in the thirty-fourth year of her age.

=== A few words of tender counsel and advice to Friends, given forth by Mercy Johnson upon her dying bed, two days before she died; which she desired might be communicated to Friends.

Dear friends, both old and young, wherever these may come, my love salutes you dearly,
desiring the welfare of your bodies and souls.
I have in my measure labored among Friends in many places while with them,
for the prosperity of truth and good of souls, and now shall be taken away.
I find great concern upon me to leave as advice and tender caution to all,
that you may keep near to truth, and love it, seeking the honour of it above all things.
Dear Friends, love one another, and as you have an eye to truth,
and seek the honor of it before your own, then will your love flow one unto another;
and whispering, with backbiting, and tale-bearing, will be removed from you,
for I have seen the ill effects of such things many times.
And, dear Friends, in your meetings for business upon truth`'s account,
have your eye to the Lord, and wait to have your minds stayed upon him,
respecting one another above yourselves for truth`'s sake,
and you waiting upon the Lord to work in you, and for you,
and to open your mouths to speak a word in season.

Reason not, but give up freely to act and speak for truth, whether you be young or old;
not in high-mindedness, but in true fear before the Lord.
For I must tell you, the humble, and those that abase themselves, the Lord will exalt;
but the high-minded, and those of an exalted spirit, the Lord will abase and humble,
and make them know he is God, and will be bowed to by every high spirit.

Therefore, dear friends, let the truth have the reign in you, to govern your words,
though never so few, that they may be rightly seasoned with grace,
that so you may edify one another.
Permit no unruly spirit to appear in your meetings, neither in old nor young;
but stand in the counsel of God, and he will give you a word in due season,
to stop the mouths of all gainsayers of the blessed truth,
and of the work you are called to do in your days.
Thus the Lord will bless, and more and more prosper his work in you, to your comfort,
and his eternal praise, to whom all is due.
I can tell you, it will be well with you to be faithful to the Lord,
when you come to a dying-bed, as I now am.
I feel peace and true consolation with the Lord, and my love herein dearly salutes you,
and bids you all farewell, who am your dear and tender sister,

TACY DAVIS, wife of Richard Davis, of Welsh Pool, in Montgomeryshire,
formerly dwelt in London, but after her marriage,
removed with her husband to Pool aforesaid, where were few or no Friends at that time,
which was about the year 1659.
She had a public testimony in meetings, and was instrumental to bring many to the truth,
and was an entertainer, with her husband, of strangers,
and a nursing mother to those in prison for the testimony of a good conscience.
They lived together to old age,
and she cheerfully went through the various exercises and hard sufferings which attended,
in those days, those that professed the blessed truth.

She was taken sick the 29th of the Second month, 1705,
and had been at a meeting the same day, which was kept at their house about forty years.
After the extremity of her pain was somewhat abated, she said,
'`People do not think it so hard to die, as I find it;`' and prayed thus; '`O Lord,
accept of me in your well-beloved Son, Christ Jesus.
I have loved you with all my soul and spirit.
I have kept your commandments.
Oh!
Lord, bless my family with all heavenly blessings;
grant to them that they may live in your fear.`'
She said to the servant-maid, who was not a Friend,
'`Remember your Creator in the days of your youth;
leave off your vanity before such a day as this overtake you.
I have nothing to do but to strive with this natural distemper.
I loved the Lord in my young days, and he kept me from many evils;
and when he was pleased to make known his blessed truth to me,
he helped me to work out my salvation with fear and trembling.
That work I have not to do now; the Lord Jesus Christ did it in me,
and for me;`' upon which the maid wept much.

At another time, pain coming on her, she said, '`I feel I am of a strong constitution,
and that nature would not yield to my distemper;`' and prayed fervently, saying, '`Come,
Lord Jesus Christ, come quickly and put an end to my pain.
Lord, I long to be with you forever.`'
Another time she prayed, '`Lord, I am the workmanship of your hands;
you have often helped me in the time of need,
for your name`'s sake help me now in the time of my distress; you are my God, my hope,
and my help, I will trust in you, oh my God!
Oh God! hasten your coming for your son Christ Jesus`'s sake.`'
Another time she said to her husband, '`I have done too little for the Lord.`'
Her husband put her in mind of her many former services,
and particularly visiting his servants when in prison for Christ`'s sake,
feeding them when hungry, entertaining strangers, and when sick,
very tender in helping them, etc., she replied,
'`All this is too little to do for the Lord Jesus`'s sake, who has loved us.
We must not depend upon these things,
but we must depend and trust in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ;
and when we have done all, let us account ourselves unprofitable servants,
for we have done but that which was our duty.`'
A little before she died,
she desired her husband to praise the Lord with her for all his mercies, and said,
'`At this time I feel his living presence to my great comfort.`'
She prayed herself, saying, '`O Lord, you have been a father to me,
you have kept me from evil, and now I trust in your great name,
that you will not forsake me; for your Son Christ Jesus`'s sake, take me to yourself.`'

And she was heard: about the sixth hour in the afternoon,
on the First-day of the Third month, in the year 1705,
the Lord in his love and mercy took her to himself,
in great quietness and peace of spirit, in about the ninetieth year of her age.

MERCY EMES, was the wife of Charles Emes, of Warwick, and daughter of John Garner,
of Kinningsworth, of the same county, yeoman.
Her first husband`'s name was Charles Devale, a Frenchman,
who was formerly a priest of the church of England, and chaplain to the Earl of Essex,
but for conscience-sake he left that church, and joined with the Baptists in London;
among which people he continued until his death.
The said Mercy, before she was his wife, attended upon the countess of Ranclagh,
from which family Charles Devale married her.
She did from a child seek after the kingdom of heaven,
and when she was among the Baptists,
was dissatisfied with the doctrine which she often
heard preached of God`'s absolute reprobation of men;
and upon that account sought for a people who had better tidings to preach.
In her inquiry she came to a meeting of the people called Quakers,
where she heard preached the "`free grace of God, which brings salvation,
that it appeared to all men, teaching them to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts;
that we should live soberly, and righteously, and godly, in this present world, etc.`"

From that time she, with two other of her acquaintance who were with her,
left the Baptists and embraced the truth,
and joined in fellowship with the people called Quakers;
among which people she married Charles Emes.
She often praised the Lord for the knowledge of his truth,
which she loved and valued above all outward enjoyments,
and ordered her conduct according thereto, unto the end of her days.

Her sickness held her about five weeks,
in which time she said it was a good thing to be ready to die,
and not to have that work to do when we are to leave the world.
The Lord was large in his love to her;
for which she blessed his name in the sense of his mercy;
and as her friends and neighbors came to visit her,
she exhorted them in great love and tenderness,
which caused much brokenness of heart among them.
One visiting her, she said, '`I have a love to you; you are convinced, but not converted;
hold on your way, the Lord will do you good.`'
Another time, two friends visiting her, one inquired how she did, she answered,
'`I am a dying woman; I am going to my God and your God;`' she said,
'`Why so long coming to see me?`'
he told her the reason: she replied, '`Your heart is towards Zion,
and so is the other friend`'s; keep your shoulder to the work which God has put upon you;
hold him forth to the nations; be not ashamed of Christ, he is a glorious Savior;
if I should live I must declare it; if I live I cannot hold my peace.`'

She testified to the service of women`'s meetings, saying,
'`Women have a service for God as well as men, and women`'s meetings are of service,
and this is my testimony before I die.`'
To a friend who was under some doubtful thoughts, she spoke by way of encouragement,
saying, '`You will meet with many troubles,
but it will be well with you in the end;`' with more words to that purpose.
She spent much of the time of her sickness in praising God.
The day before she died,
she spoke to several friends concerning their states and conditions in the truth.
She was freely resigned to die, and nothing seemed hard to her to part with,
except her two little children, of whom she often said,
'`My little babes;`' but she declared her satisfaction
that the Lord would provide for them,
which is in part fulfilled already.
A few hours before she died, her husband coming to her bedside about midnight,
found her pouring out her soul to the Lord, and she said to him,
'`The sting of death is taken away; I am not afraid to die.
I have the evidence of God`'s love sealed to me:
my bed is a bed of roses;`' which expression she used several times in her sickness;
so resigning her soul unto the Lord.

She finished this life the 31st of the Eighth month, 1697,
and was buried among friends at Warwick.

SARAH KIRKBRIDE, wife of Joseph Kirkbride, of Pennsylvania, and daughter of Mahlon Stacy,
of West Jersey, in America, was virtuous from her childhood,
and very dutiful to her parents, and an example of piety to her latter end.
She was taken sick the 24th day of the Ninth month, 1703.
In the time of her sickness she uttered many living and weighty expressions,
desiring to be dissolved, saying, '`I have not been afraid of death these many years;
death is no terror unto me; my God has taken away its sting.`'
She being under great weight of bodily affliction,
and seeing her husband under trouble for her, said, '`My dear,
if it please the Lord to strip you of your help-mate again, my God will be your rock,
he has been your stay hitherto, and he will never leave you.
The Lord will bring me to his holy hill, and I shall praise him upon Mount Zion,
with the saints and holy angels.`'

She again said, '`I shall praise you, O my God, and my Christ, world without end.`'
Soon after, her husband was moved to pray by her,
that the Lord would be pleased to support and strengthen
her in her distress and great affliction,
and to bear up her exercised soul,
and to make them truly willing to submit to his holy will, whether in life or death;
at which words she said, '`Amen, Amen.`'
A little after, her husband asked her how she did, she said,
'`I am sweetly comforted in my affliction; the Lord is exceeding good to my soul.`'
Many more good expressions she uttered upon several occasions, that cannot be remembered.
The evening before she departed this life, some friends being come to see her, she said,
'`I am weak of body, but the Lord is very good to my soul,
and has filled me with his love; but my bodily weakness is such,
that it renders me incapable of praising him as I ought to do.`'
To her husband she said, '`The Lord has heard your prayers for me this morning,
and has satisfied my soul to the full;`' more she said to the same purpose,
taking her husband`'s children by the hand, embracing them,
and exhorting them to fear the Lord, and to love and obey their father; and said,
'`He has been a good father to you.`'
A little before she died, she said, '`My God, I come,
I come;`' and soon after she departed this life,
and is entered into that rest that will never have an end.

She died the 28th of the Ninth month, 1705, aged twenty-nine years.

SARAH THOMPSON, daughter of George Thompson, of Crook, in Westmoreland, was a maid who,
in her life-time, did truly fear the Lord,
and remembered her Creator in the days of her youth.
She sought the honor and promotion of truth,
according to the measure of grace which she had received;
and according to the understanding God had given her, she was faithful,
and her understanding was good, and capacity large in things natural,
as well as religious.
She took great delight in reading the Holy Scriptures, and other religious books,
and was careful to put in practice what she did read,
and would often be speaking of heavenly things in the family,
and exhorting to virtue and patience;
for it was a great trouble to her when she saw any
impatience or indifference in the family.
She was obedient to her parents, and very tender over them;
kind and compassionate to all, and was beloved of them that knew her.
Her temper was sweet, and of a cheerful spirit and good courage, but not rash,
and of few words,
and very careful not to give offense to those she was at any time in company with,
who were not of our profession in religion,
and very sorrowful when she saw any professing the truth,
who did not walk answerably to the same.

She was much afflicted with shortness of breath, which she patiently bore,
and would say she dared not murmur at it, lest she should offend the Lord.
She often retired alone into solitary places, and said that when she had been alone,
and meditating upon the things of God,
that the Lord did wonderfully break in upon her soul,
by his glorious light and good spirit, and let her see over the world, time,
and mortality, into eternity, which appearance of his presence did very much affect her.
She also said that the Lord had showed her that the time would
not be long until he would ease her of all her pain and sorrow,
and take her to himself.
Another time she said the Lord was present with her,
and comforted her in the midst of all her afflictions,
and spoke peace to her soul in the midst of her troubles,
which she said made hard things easy to her.

She sickened the 1st of the Twelfth month, 1702.
In the time of her illness the Lord`'s power and presence attended her,
and she uttered many weighty expressions, with wholesome counsel and advice,
to the comfort of those about her.
Observing her friends sorrowful, she said, '`You trouble me to see you so;
why are you so unwise?
It would be more satisfaction to me, if you did not one of you shed a tear for me;
must we not all part?
What! is death a terror to you?
It is no terror to me.
I am not at all daunted at it, for I am content whether I live or die;
for if I am spared at this time, you must not keep me long,
having been sensible some time, that I have not long to live.
Cannot you freely give me up, and part with me?
I am but a poor infirm creature, and it will be well with me.
I shall be freed from many troubles, and from many dangers,
which you will be exposed to that stay behind; for I see as long as we are here,
we are liable to many temptations.
I know they will be exercises to you, but keep to that which is good,
and God will keep you, for he has kept me many a time, as I have kept my mind to him.`'
This she spoke on the Sixth day of the week, in the afternoon.

At another time, her father and mother, and two sisters, standing at her bedside,
she said to them, '`I must die; and I have a word of counsel to you all;
be faithful to your gifts that God has given you; I beg it of you;
and overcharge not your minds with any thing of this world,
for you see how frail flesh is,
and how soon we are gone;`' with many more weighty expressions which were not remembered.
After this she said, '`I desire you to remember my words when I am gone,
that it may be well with you at your latter end,
that you and I may meet in the mansions of glory, where we may never part.
And be all of you content, for it is well with me.
I have made my peace with God, and I feel nothing to rise up in judgment against me,
for the Lord has forgiven me my sins and my iniquities,
and I feel my mind is very quiet and still,
and has been ever since I begun with this illness.
There is nothing cumbers my mind, not so much as a temptation is presented,
and I have been borne over my exercises far beyond my expectation.`'

Her brother Isaac being from home, in the service of truth, she said,
'`Remember my dear love to my dear brother.
If I die, tell him from me, that my soul is gone into everlasting rest,
where I hope we shall meet again in the heavenly joy, where we shall never part.
I think I have done,
and I will take my leave of you;`' then taking them one by one by the hand,
she kissed them, and bade them all farewell; and said,
'`I do not know when my life will go; I would gladly die.`'
She prayed to the Lord, and continued in prayer a considerable time;
in which she was very powerful, and was filled with divine praises,
and the power of God was felt by them that were present with her,
and their hearts were abundantly comforted,
and were made to bless the name of the Lord on her behalf.
She prayed fervently for the preservation of those
who should be left behind when she was gone;
he had kept and preserved her from the many hurtful things that are in this world,
and that he would help them through their exercises, as he had helped her many a time,
for which she blessed his name,
and so concluded her prayer with returning living praises and thanksgivings unto God.
Then she signified to them how she had felt the
Lord`'s power to support her in her life-time;
'`for,`' said she, '`I have often cried to the Lord to help me through my exercises,
and he has answered my prayer many a time, to my great admiration.`'

She lay still a while, and afterwards began to pray again to the Lord,
with a heavenly sweet melody, which did attend her; but she spoke so low,
few of her words could be distinctly understood by them that were present.
Then she asked for her grandmother, who was above eighty years of age, who coming to her,
she took her by the hand, and said to her, '`You are now very ancient:
the Lord has been very merciful to you, and has given you many years,
far above what many attain to; and if you come short of making your peace with God,
you can not say it was for lack of days.
But see to the improvement of your gift, I beg of you before your days be over,
that it may be well with you at your latter end,
that your soul and mine may meet again in heavenly joy.`'
Her cousin, Robert Thompson, a young man, coming in, asked her how she did; she answered,
'`I am passing away in peace, and so may all do that keep faithful to their God.`'
Then lying quiet, and slumbering a little, afterwards said,
I have had a sweet dream;`' her mother asked what: she answered,
'`I thought there were four angels that were conducting me to the land of rest.
I have had this dream, '`said she, '`twice over, but I am here yet.
I am long a going, you have waited long: '`her mother said,
'`Your death is hard to win;`' she said, '`It will come by and by,
I have prayed to the Lord to make my way easy through death.`'

Her sickness increasing upon her, she grew very weak,
so that it was thought she would not have spoken any more,
it being about two hours before her departure,
yet the Lord was pleased to give her strength again,
so that many weighty words proceeded from her,
to the tendering of the hearts of them that were about her, both friends and others.
Speaking to her father and mother, desiring them not to mind the things of this world,
but to serve the Lord in their day, who is worthy to be served, who is the Lord of lords,
and the King of kings; desiring them to remember the words of their dying daughter;
exhorting to love and charity, and to be prepared for their latter end,
where they might meet in everlasting joy, never to part.
Then asking for her cousin above-named, he came to her, and she said, '`Dear cousin,
whom I love as my own soul, you are young, and in the prime of your time,
see you serve God in the flower of your age.
The Lord has created you that you might serve him;
see you answer the end for which you were created.
And dear cousin, I believe the Lord has a service for you if you be faithful to him,
and I wish well for your soul, as for my own,
desiring you may be faithful to God in your day, that you may have your account ready,
against the day of dissolution, that you and I may meet again,
where we shall live to sing Hosannah to the Lord forevermore.`'

Asking for one who was related to her, she said,
'`I have something to say to him;`' he coming to her, she said to him,
'`I remember there was a time when you thought you should have died,
and you were under great exercise, for I believe you had lived a very loose life,
and the Lord smote you with his judgments, and I remember you made a vow,
that if the Lord would spare you at that time, you would amend and do so no more;
and it pleased the Lord to spare you; but oh!`' said she, '`have you fulfilled your vow?`'
She exhorted him to more faithfulness, that he might obtain peace to his soul,
before the day of his visitation went over his head.
She said to her sisters, '`Be sure you be good to my mother when I am gone,
and mind not the fading things of this world;`' after which she spoke not many words;
but if she was asked how she did, she would reply, '`I am very well, and in a sweet frame;
I am going to a sweet place!`'

She departed the 6th day of the Twelfth month, being the Seventh day of the week,
about the first hour in the afternoon, 1702.
Aged nineteen years.

JAMES BAINES, son of William and Sarah Baines,
of Strangerthwait in the county of Westmoreland,
was one who began to seek the Lord in his young years.
As he grew in sincerity and zeal for the blessed truth,
and increased in his concern for the promotion thereof, some time before he died,
God opened his mouth in a public testimony for the Lord Jesus Christ and his pure religion;
in which he was very fervent,
having a sight how eminently God would appear for those who were faithful.
He had a word of encouragement to them,
but was sharp in judgment to the backsliders and unfaithful:
and although he was under much affliction,
by reason of bodily infirmities and distempers which grew upon him,
yet he was more and more devoted to truth`'s service,
as if he had known that his time was not to be long in this world,
even to within some hours that his last sickness seized upon him.
Notwithstanding he was under great pain and exercise of body,
yet the power and presence of the Lord were with him,
which was his great support and strength.
He often spoke of the goodness of God to his soul, and of that inward sweetness,
peace and comfort, that the Lord was pleased to afford to him in his afflictions,
to the great satisfaction of those who were present.

He gave much wholesome advice in the time of his sickness to Friends and others,
and spoke of the prosperity of truth, and said in particular to his relations as follows:
'`As we are children of believing parents, and have had our education among Friends,
so I would not have you to rest contented there, but be solid, and weighty,
and humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God;
and as you abide here you will feel the goodness of the Lord to spring in your souls,
to your great comfort and inward peace and satisfaction.
I know our natural tempers are inclinable to be light and airy, like other people,
therefore we have more occasion to be bowed and weighty in our minds.`'
Speaking concerning tithes,
he desired Friends would keep up their testimony against them; '`For,`' said he,
'`I could have slipped sufferings if I would have given way to it,
but it was a thing I dared not do;
but I accounted it a great mercy that the Lord had blessed me with
something to part with for his name and truth`'s sake.`'
Although he suffered pretty much at times, upon the account of tithes,
yet the Lord`'s goodness to him did overbalance all,
so that he had a word of encouragement to others on that account.

Upon occasion, speaking of the uncertainty of riches, he said,
'`At some time I pursued them,
and they fled from me;`' but this use he said he made of
it; '`to conclude it was not a city here I was to look after,
but one in the heavens, whose maker and builder is God.`'
This he spoke as caution to others.
At several times he expressed his great peace with God here,
and full assurance of eternal blessedness in the world to come,
through the atonement made by the Lord Jesus Christ,
and the work of sanctification of his Spirit.
The day before he died, hearing that that ancient Friend, Anne Camm, was deceased,
he said, '`Ah! that honest, honorable woman, is she gone to her eternal rest before me?
I shall follow her very shortly, where we shall meet never to part again.`'
Many were the comfortable expressions and seasonable
advices which he gave forth in his sickness,
that cannot be remembered; and as, in his lifetime, he honored the truth,
so was his latter end comfortable and full of peace; in which he departed this life,
the 1st of the Tenth month, 1705, aged fifty-one years;
and was buried at Friends`' burying-ground, at Sedbergh meetinghouse.

=== The Testimony of Isaac Alexander concerning James Baines, in a letter dated the 8th of the Tenth month, 1705, who also died the 11th of the Twelfth month, after him.

Our truly beloved and esteemed friend, James Baines,
departed this life the 1st of this instant; and though he was afflicted with great pain,
yet he bore it with admirable patience.
Though I live remote from him, and notwithstanding my unfitness,
I went often to visit him; and I do not remember that since I came among Friends,
any Friend was so universally visited by all sorts of people as he was,
especially by faithful Friends.
Neither did I ever visit a Friend in such a case,
who had that reach upon all sorts of people,
both in the expressions he declared in the time of his sickness,
and also the frame of his spirit.
It was admirably reaching and melting, beyond what I can express,
and so continued to the end, as sweet and sensible as ever.
He died with the greatest esteem and love to Friends and truth,
and in great esteem and interest in the hearts of Friends;
he died in a most happy and blessed condition.

JOHN BLAIKLING, of Draw-well, In the parish of Sedbergh, in Yorkshire,
bordering on Westmoreland, was born in the Ninth month, 1625, and he and his wife,
and his father and mother,
were people of good repute and esteem among all that knew them,
being all very religiously inclined from their youth.
They were all convinced of the truth in the Third month, 1652,
by the ministry of that truly honorable servant of Christ, George Fox,
whom they received into their house with joy,
because of the glad tidings of salvation that he brought to them;
soon after which John Blaikling accompanied George Fox to Firbank chapel,
where many were also convinced of truth.
About the latter end of the year 1654, or beginning of 1655,
John Blaikling received a dispensation of the gospel to publish to the world,
and was very serviceable therein to many, and soon after,
he was called by the Lord into the county of Durham, Northumberland,
and the east of Yorkshire, where he had then,
and many times since in his frequent visits of those places, good service,
and was with great respect received and loved while he lived.
A few years after, he travelled into Scotland, visiting a great part of that nation,
and in his return, as well as going out, visited the northern counties of England.
After it pleased God to raise up others to bear testimony
of his truth in the meeting John Blaikling belonged to,
and the adjacent meetings, to answer the service in part,
which before lay much upon John, he was not only glad thereof,
but a great encourager of them,
and all others at all times that came up in a public testimony for the Lord Jesus Christ,
who is the true light.

He also travelled into many other cities and counties; as at London, Bristol,
Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, and most counties of England,
and many times to London;
in which service he faithfully continued till weakness of body and old age prevented.
The last time he visited London, was when he came up to the yearly meeting in 1698;
that service being over, he visited the most of Friends`' meetings in the county of Kent,
and his service was very acceptable among them.

He was endued with a great gift of discerning, of solid judgment,
and deep understanding in heavenly things,
as well as in the things relating to this life; his ministry was attended with power,
and though his utterance was not eloquent, yet full of profound and weighty matter,
suitable to the several states in the auditory where he did minister.
He was an example in a tender, humble life and conduct,
and zealous for good order in the Church of Christ,
as well as steadfast in opposing and bearing testimony
against such as would endeavor to break unity,
and so lead into a loose liberty, disorder, and confusion, as well as other evil works.
It was at J. Blaikling`'s house, which is called Draw-well,
that the memorable meeting was held for the endeavoring the recovery of John Story,
and John Wilkinson, and others,
who opposed the good order and discipline now established in the churches of Christ.
The said meeting began upon the 3rd day of the Second month, 1676,
and continued four days:
but notwithstanding the labors of many brethren met
at that time from several parts of the nation,
and particularly four Friends from the city of London,
the said John Story and John Wilkinson continued
in their contention and opposition to Friends;
and not long after William Rogers published a book against Friends, which J. Blaikling,
etc., answered, entitled '`Anti-christian treachery discovered,
and its way blocked up;`' a volume in folio, of about 50 sheets.

He was a great supporter of such as were in low circumstances in the world,
often assisted them in difficult cases, to the exposing himself to great hazard of loss;
and many times he was blessed with good success therein.
He obtained the blessing of a peace-maker, being of a good understanding,
was qualified with judgment and patience to reconcile differences about temporal affairs,
which was a means to bring him into many concerns of trust for orphans, etc.,
which is always attended with great care and trouble, and which often fell to his lot.
The loss of him in the church, as well as among the neighborhood, is great.
He was not only called to believe in, and preach Christ Jesus, the truth, the way,
and the life, but also to suffer for his name`'s sake,
not only by loss of goods to a great value,
but also by imprisonments several times at York, about sixty miles from his family,
both on account of meetings for the worship of God,
and in a firm testimony against tithes.
While he had strength, he was diligent in attending meetings;
but old age and bodily infirmities growing upon him latterly, sometimes prevented him.
Several times he expressed to friends in private the comfort that he had in the
Lord`'s peace and presence with him to his satisfaction in his old age,
and that his day`'s work was nigh done, and his reward and rest with God sure.
This testimony agrees with the last letter I received from him, save one part,
as follows:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

[.salutation]
Dear John,
I love you in the truest love that springs from Jesus Christ the fountain thereof,
by and in which my life stands;
though as to bodily health and strength I grow weak and feeble,
but my life in God stands, whose I am, and I am comfortably content.
I am scarcely able to walk to the door, nor have I been at a meeting these several weeks,
but the Lord`'s will be done.
I am comforted in the remembrance of my former services for the Lord, his truth,
and people, for which I lack not my reward in this my old age.
I take time to read.
I am almost blind, yet well content.

[.signed-section-signature]
John Blaikling

He often signified his preparedness to leave this world,
with fervent desires for truth`'s prosperity,
and the preservation of unity and concord among brethren,
in a faithful and steady testimony for the same in every part thereof,
as led into by God`'s power in the beginning.
Not long before his death,
his ancient and intimate friend and acquaintance Thomas Camm being with him,
he said to him, '`You and I have not sought our own interest,
but have devoted ourselves to serve the Lord, his truth and people; he is,
and will be our great reward in the end of all our troubles.
I am greatly satisfied that I have faithfully served the Lord, and done my day`'s work,
and enjoy the earnest of that peace and rest God has laid up for his people;
and if you and I shall never have opportunity to meet again in the outward,
yet in eternity our spirits, with the spirits of just men made perfect,
shall meet never to part again.
I pray God with all my soul, if it be his will for his truth and people`'s sake,
to lengthen your days, and grant that strength of body and health,
that at least you may be able once more to visit London, Bristol,
and the southern parts of this nation, which will be of great service,
and acceptable unto many.`'
This he spoke with great tenderness of spirit; to which Thomas Camm replied,
'`The will of the Lord be done, I am in his hand:`'
so in much brokenness embracing and kissing each other, they parted;
this was four or five days before his death.
He had a short sickness, and an easy death, falling into a fainting fit,
as sometimes before.

He passed quietly away out of this world, without sigh or groan,
short about four months of eighty years,
and was honorably buried at Friends`' burial-place, at Sedbergh meetinghouse,
the 4th day of the Fifth month, 1705.

THOMAS GILPIN was born in the year 1622, son of Thomas Gilpin, of Mill-hill,
in the parish of Caton, near Lancaster.
His parents had five sons, and five daughters, whereof Thomas was youngest son;
they were people of good repute in the country, and were religious,
being called Puritans, who educated their children very strictly.
After his father`'s decease, his mother removed with her children to Kendal,
in Westmoreland, five of her children being dead;
and she was so zealous as to force them into acts
of religion before they knew what they did,
as to pray without a form, etc.
Thomas being but about ten years of age, considered it was not right,
for he said he knew not who to pray to.
After he grew up in more years, and his mother deceased,
he ran into foolish and wanton delights, as sports and pastime, music and dancing.
He went to London as apprentice to a tallow-chandler, and after went into the wars,
(being the time of the civil wars in England,) where he was tempted into more evils.
Yet in all this time the Lord followed him by his good spirit,
reproving him in his own conscience for his sins,
which brought great fear and trouble upon him;
but by one means or other he endeavored to get over these convictions,
and so continued a considerable time striving against the good spirit of God.
But oftentimes the Lord again did awaken him,
and brought the consideration of death upon him, even in the time of sickness,
and of battle, which he was often in.
Then he would cry to the Lord for mercy,
and that he would deliver him from death at such times,
making promises of reformation for the future.
And God was merciful and spared him, yet he forgot his promises and covenants,
and fell into the same evils again;
after which the Lord brought double fear and torment upon him.

At last he received the blessed truth, as preached by the people called Quakers;
and in believing in and obeying the light and spirit
of Christ manifested in his own heart,
he came to receive power over those sins which had prevailed in times past over him,
and so came truly to know repentance, and remission of sins, in the name of Jesus Christ,
the true light of the world.
And afterwards,
in the remembrance of the unspeakable long-suffering and mercy of God unto him,
he said in his life-time,
'`Shall it not be recorded to posterity for the benefit of my children,
and my children`'s children, that it may be a warning to the obstinate and rebellious,
to turn from the evil of their ways, while the spirit of the Lord strives with them,
lest the day of their visitation go over their heads.`'

In 1653 Ambrose Rigg, Thomas Robinson, and Jane Waugh, came into the county of Oxford,
to preach the free gospel of the grace of God;
at which time Thomas Gilpin received their testimony.
After eight or nine years waiting upon God in silence,
God gave him a dispensation of the same gospel to preach to others,
and he became an able minister, showing himself approved unto God,
a workman that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
In this service he labored much, traveling through many parts of England,
but chiefly in the counties of Oxford, Berks, and Bucks;
he was a prisoner for his testimony to the truth twice at Oxford,
and once in Newgate in London.
His settlement was in the parish of Warborough, in the county of Oxford,
where he married Joan, the daughter of Thomas Bartholomew, of the same parish,
husbandman;
in which place he was instrumental to settle a church
or meeting of the people called Quakers,
which remains to this day, as well as in many other parts where he travelled.
He was successful by his ministry to turn many to righteousness,
and for building them up, and establishing them in the most holy faith.

In the year 1702, and the eightieth of his age,
he was weak in body for the most part of the winter,
but complained little of either sickness or pain, his body gradually decaying.
In the time of his sickness he desired one of his
sons to remember his dear love to friends,
and give them account of his sickness and departure.
As he was zealous for God and his truth in the time of his health, so he was to his end,
for he went to Friends`' meetings for the worship of God as long as he was able, saying,
'`I am willing to be a good example so long as I have strength to go.`'
When he was so weak that he could hardly go out of his chamber,
he desired friends to meet in his room, which was not long before he died;
at which time he signified to friends that he was satisfied,
that as to words he must cease, but this was his comfort,
that he enjoyed the power of the Word of life, which is beyond all words.
He exhorted friends to faithfulness, and to keep their meetings,
and not to look out at his being removed from them;
putting them in mind of the goodness and love of God,
which had been largely manifested both to him and them,
in carrying them through many trials and exercises,
and in preserving them in love and unity one with another,
which he desired they would be careful to continue in.
When he had done speaking, a friend prayed,
and Thomas Gilpin`'s heart was much comforted in feeling the presence of the Lord,
as well as those present, who were much tendered and broken into tears,
and at the conclusion he again recommended love and unity one with another;
and also declared that he was given up in the will of the Lord,
and took his leave of them all.

This was the last meeting he had with friends; but he was much visited by friends,
and it was a comfort and delight to him to see them,
and sometimes it was hard for him to part with them, saying,
'`This is such a parting as we never had before.`'
The Lord was very good to him all the time of his sickness,
and did often cause his heart in the feeling of life
to sound forth praises to the name of God;
and he said he believed he as much desired to die, as ever any one did desire to live,
although he lacked nothing in this world; but said, '`I long to be dissolved,
and be with the Lord, yet am willing to wait God`'s good pleasure.`'
The day before he died, i.e. the 2nd of the 12th month, some friends visiting him,
he desired one of them to supplicate the Lord on his behalf, to put an end to his days,
and make his passage easy.
After some time the friend prayed to that purpose; when he had done,
Thomas Gilpin lifting up his hands, said,
'`The Lord grant your request which you have made to him this day.`'
Though at that time to outward appearance he seemed likely to have lived some days,
yet he quickly altered, and the morrow, about the fifth hour in the afternoon,
he departed this life, being the 3rd day of the Twelfth month, 1702.
He left behind him three sons and two daughters, and all of them had children.

He was buried honorably the 8th of the Twelfth month, 1702,
after he had professed truth forty-nine years,
and had been a minister of the gospel forty years.

RICHARD ANDREWS, son of Richard Andrews, late of London, silk-man, and his mother,
one of the daughters of our ancient friend, Thomas Gilpin aforesaid,
was educated by his father-in-law, Moses West, of Hempsted, in Hertfordshire,
and his own mother, not only in useful learning,
in order to his accomplishment for trade and good settlement in the world,
but also it was their great care to have him brought up in the way of truth.
He was put apprentice in London to the silk trade; but after some years,
what by the examples of others, and temptations of the enemy,
he declined from his former simplicity and sobriety, and good inclination to truth,
into more liberty and vain company and fashions of the world,
which was a grief to his father and mother.

He was taken ill about eight or nine months before he died, of a decay of nature,
which terminated in a consumption; and such was the goodness of God to him,
that he was awakened in himself to a consideration of his inward condition,
the visitation of God by his spirit being upon him,
and he had frequent visions in the night of the near approach of his latter end.
Being at Hempsted with his father and mother,
he had opportunity to retire alone into private places,
where he poured out his soul to the Lord in supplication,
and great travail of soul came upon him, especially towards his latter end,
for he was bowed in deep humility, praying for the light of God`'s countenance,
in whose presence is life, peace and comfort.
But the Lord was pleased to chastise him, by hiding his face from him for a time,
yet he kept his hold, trusting in the Lord;
though in this state he met with many assaults from the devil,
and temptations to despond of God`'s mercy.
Now he knew what it was to read in the book of conscience,
and for his works to go beforehand to judgment.
Now he disliked the company of those young men, his former companions,
with whom he used to walk abroad in the fields, sometimes on First-day afternoon,
and neglecting going to meeting for the public worship of God,
which now became a very great trouble to him,
and that he should spend his precious time so vainly.
His powdering and apparel, and such like follies,
he particularly expressed a great sorrow for,
promising that if the Lord should prolong his days,
he would endeavor to follow the best examples and
strictest way of living among faithful Friends;
calling to mind, and praising the good life of his grandfather Gilpin.

A friend visiting him,
together with the good advice of his father concerning the Lord`'s hand that was upon him,
it being not in anger but in mercy, that he might turn unto him,
with fervent desire after him, and enjoyment of him, and when he should obtain that,
his needs should be supplied; so after some time the Lord did appear in him,
and did lift up his spirit as a standard against the enemy of his soul,
who came in like a flood, and tempted him to doubt of his mercy,
so that he was comforted like a man reprieved from judgment,
though not as yet having a full assurance of his pardon;
but a living hope sprang up more and more, which became as an anchor to his mind.
His company became delightful, because of those serious reflections he made on things,
and religious discourses which he had with those about him.
One time he said to his father and mother, '`I will appeal to you,
if you ever heard me repine at the exercise and pain
I have gone through since I have been at home,
all this time of my great weakness?
'`No,`' said he, '`I have desired the Lord to let me have all my punishment in this life.`'
Indeed, he was sweet and cheerful under all his pain, which was very great;
and he grew very bright and living when he had got dominion over his doubts and fears.

Near his latter end, through the prevalence of his distemper,
he was somewhat broken in understanding, and wandered in his discourse,
though his talk was inoffensive; yet, as if he had foreseen this, a little before,
a kinsman of his, not one called a Quaker, offered to tarry with him;
to which he showed himself unwilling, giving this reason to his father and mother,
saying, '`May be I shall be light-headed, and ramble in my words,
and he or others may inconsiderately reflect upon my profession.`'
Though his sickness was long, his death was pretty sudden,
having kept his bed but four days, in which time, while sensible,
he was kept in a most sweet, resigned frame of soul;
being by his bedside was like being in a well-replenished meeting.
Near his end, he said to his father and mother, '`Do not grieve, the Lord is with me,`'
with much more to the same purpose; so lying still and quiet, he went away with a smile,
and is at peace with the Lord.
He died about the twenty-first year of his age.

PRISCILLA RICHARDS, daughter of John Richards, of Howsey, near Liskeard,
in the county of Cornwall, and of Priscilla his wife,
was born at Liskeard the 18th of the Sixth month, 1680;
and though educated in her father`'s family,
who were mostly strangers to the living way of truth, now in this our age revealed,
only her mother frequented the meetings of the people called Quakers;
yet did this young maiden begin according to the advice of the wise man,
to remember her Creator in the days of her youth.
She not only came to the meetings of the said people,
but turned with her heart to the Lord; and as she came towards seventeen years of age,
she grew in the fear of God, and in plainness and solidity,
not regarding the gaiety of this perishing world so as to set her heart thereon,
but became very modest in her habit, speech, gesture, and in all her deportment,
and was greatly in love with the company of the best Friends,
to whom she also became very acceptable.
Though the family in which she lived might minister occasion to her,
to look out at the ways and glory of this world, yet she was as one weaned therefrom,
and delighted in retirement of spirit,
and in that society which might be helpful to her in her
way to that heavenly habitation to which she was traveling,
and whereunto the Lord brought her in the very prime of her blooming years.

She was scarcely twenty years of age when she was visited with some infirmities of body,
which still drove her nearer the Lord;
and although she met with some exercises grievous to her tender spirit,
yet she was resigned to the will of God.
About the beginning of the year 1704, it was perceived by some symptoms,
that her distemper tended to a dropsy, in which abundance of care,
both of parents and able physicians was used, yet her disease increased,
so that it was apparent some months before she died,
that there was little or no hopes of her recovery, which she foresaw,
yet was very well satisfied and resigned to the will of God,
in which she had peace and great quietness of mind,
and would often testify as much to her mother and those about her,
as well as friends who frequently visited her;
for she having her affections drawn out of the world,
it became easier to her to leave it.

In a letter to a particular friend, who married her near relation,
written about fourteen days before she died, she says thus:

[.salutation]
Dear Cousin,

I should have given an account of my sickness, but exceeding illness hindered me,
and my mother, what with sorrow for me, and lack of time, occasioned the same neglect.
I am now very ill, being swollen all over my body, except my hands and arms,
and am scarcely able to walk the chamber without help;
but I am freely given up to the will of my heavenly Father, whether for life or death.
I should be glad to see any of you here,
for my time in this world is not likely to be long.
I have been a little better at my heart this four or five days,
but how it will please the Lord to deal with me, I know not.
My dear love is to you, your wife and children,
wishing you health and peace in this life, and happiness in the life to come; being,
dear cousin, your affectionate, etc.,

[.signed-section-signature]
P+++.+++ Richards

--

This was written in a time of great weakness of body,
but her spirit was strong in the Lord, having kept the faith,
and by it was made a conqueror.
About this time, her mother sitting by her, she said,
'`It is well for me that I feared the Lord in my youth,
seeing old age is not likely to be my lot.`'

Those friends who visited her in the time of her weakness,
were greatly comforted in the testimony she gave,
and sense they had of her living condition of soul, in a dying state of body.
To a friend who said to her, '`I hope, if you do recover,
you will live to praise the Lord;`' she replied,
'`I do not desire life upon any other terms.`'
Her expressions were many and frequent as to her peace and acquiescence of mind, but,
her friends not supposing her end to be so near, they were not duly written down.
Her mother at a certain time,
hearing her speaking of her willingness to be with the Lord, said,
'`What! Have you no sympathy with my sorrow and grief, at the parting from you,`' etc.,
she replied, '`Mother, you begin to grow old,
and it will not be long before we meet again in a better place,
if we are found doing the will of God.`'

In this sweetness of temper she abode without reluctancy
or impatience at her state of body,
which decayed daily.
On the twelfth of the Seventh month, 1704, she was taken with some fainting fits,
which made her attendants stir more than usual, at which she reviving said,
'`Why did you not let me alone, I was very easy,
and in much quiet;`' and then turning to her mother, she said, '`Time will come;
do not grieve, nor make the Lord angry.`'
To some about her, '`Do not leave repentance until a dying hour,
for the body has enough to do to bear its pains.`'
At night, her father going to bed, took leave of her.
She said, '`If she never saw or spoke to him more, she was well.`'
But then her pains returned on her, yet she got up the next day,
but had again some such dying fits, however continued till the next day after,
always being very sensible, under no manner of disturbance in mind.
On the 14th of the Seventh month, being sensibly weakened,
and feeling the approaches of death, she said, '`Come, come, come,
why so long;`' and in a very little time after called out, '`Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,`'
and presently breathed forth her last, according to her prayer to the Lord,
that she might not go stupified out of the world, for she died in full understanding,
and soundness of mind, and is gone to rest in the Lord, blessed be his name forever.

On the 18th of the Seventh month, 1704, her body was decently buried,
from her father`'s house, in Friends`' burial ground, in the parish of Liskeard.

Thus we have here an example of what one of old said of youth that is soon perfected,
which shall condemn the many years and old age of the ungodly.

WILLIAM TURNER, of Hitchin, in Hertfordshire,
was one who sought after truth and righteousness from his childhood,
and when but a youth complained to a professor that
he much desired an inward acquaintance with the Lord,
and to be acquainted with the spirit of God, was what his soul longed for.
The professor advised him to be acquainted with the Scriptures, which he had done before,
and could not be satisfied with the reading of what
God did for his people in former ages,
without feeling after God and knowing him for himself.
And it pleased the Lord in the riches of his love to answer the desires of his soul,
and to open the way of life, and to manifest the truth,
as believed by the people called Quakers.
He was convinced thereof, when he was about twenty years of age,
by the ministry of Thomas Green, and having attained to that which his soul longed for,
namely, the true knowledge of God,
he presently became obedient to the good spirit of God,
and suffered both spoiling of his goods and imprisonment for the truth`'s sake;
his love to which he manifested by bearing a faithful testimony to the same.
He was a man of a blameless life and godly conduct,
having regard to the honor of truth in all things,
seeking the advancement thereof over and above his own temporal interest.
He was a hearty lover of the friends of truth,
and especially of the faithful publishers of the gospel,
whom his heart and house were always open to receive.
He was a lover of peace and unity in the church,
and steady in his testimony against looseness and undue liberty,
and those who opposed gospel order.
He was indeed a pillar in the church, and a careful overseer in the flock,
whom sometimes he was concerned to exhort in a brief testimony;
which being delivered in much tenderness and brokenness of spirit,
was of service and comfort to the faithful people of God.

He was much afflicted with pain and weakness of body a considerable time before he died,
but bore it with much patience.
His wife cannot remember that she ever heard one unadvised
word proceed out of his mouth all the time of his illness;
and he would say, that his affliction was not laid upon him in anger,
but whom the Lord loved, he chastises.
When his wife bewailed the loss she should have of him, he said,
'`It will be better for me to go hence, for I shall be at rest and peace,
where there shall be no more trouble.`'
About three days before his death, he called for his children and said,
'`What I have to say, I shall speak in a few words, but remember them when I am gone.
Mind truth above all, and then God will bless you! and be kind to your mother,
and do nothing without her advice;
and do not marry to any but them that love truth well.`'
He charged his children to be none of them that strive to stay at home,
but strive who shall go to meeting.
A little before he died, he said,
'`I find nothing but that it will be well with me to all eternity.`'
To his eldest daughter Elizabeth, wife of John Pryor, he said,
'`Be an upright-hearted woman, and walk uprightly before the Lord.`'
He departed this life the 6th of the First month, 1704,
in the sixty-first year of his age, after he had believed in truth forty-one years.
His body was decently buried in Friends`' burying-ground at Hitchin.

FRANCIS BLAIKLING, of Winder, near Sedbergh, in Yorkshire,
was a harmless man from his youth, born of good sober parentage.
He was convinced of the blessed truth about the time
of George Fox`'s first coming to publish truth,
which was in the year 1652.
He gladly received the truth in the love of it, and faithfully walked in it,
and cheerfully suffered for it, not only extreme spoiling his goods,
but by a pretty long imprisonment in York castle.
The Lord not only gave him to believe and to suffer,
but also gave him a part of the ministry, to testify unto the blessed truth,
which he had believed in, and to that word of reconciliation, nigh in the heart.
In work, according to his measure, he was a faithful laborer,
though he did not travel far abroad; neither was his testimony long,
but it was very easy and comfortable to the faithful; and he, in a plain testimony,
hit the mark, both in reproof to the wicked and the comfort of true mourners in Zion.
He was a man well beloved, and esteemed both by Friends and others; wherefore,
in the time of his sickness, many came to visit him,
who found him in a comfortable frame of spirit;
he patiently enduring those bodily infirmities which he was under,
and much resigned in his mind to God`'s will, whether for life or death, often saying,
the Lord was, and always had been, very good and favorable to him,
and he found nothing but peace to his soul from the Lord,
and he was ready to leave this world whenever the Lord pleased to call him out of it.

Thus in much patience and cheerfulness his spirit was borne up in his sickness,
increasing in sweetness of spirit, and in expressions which are not written down,
being not perfectly remembered.
As he lived in love and unity with his brethren, so he died,
saying to many friends who came to visit him, '`Dear friend,
my love and life is with you.`'

He departed this life the 20th of the First month, 1704, aged seventy-three years,
a believer in truth fifty-two years.

An Account of some remarkable words spoken by HAYES HAMILTON, son of Hugh Hamilton,
of Ireland, a little before his death.
Aged twelve years.

He said he had been several times in a place by himself,
where he wished he had been forever,
he enjoyed so much of the comfortable presence of the Lord in silent waiting upon him,
and meditating in his law, which drew his soul in a rapture.
He also told his schoolmaster, about twelve days before he died,
the day he left the school (as the said schoolmaster did testify),
that his said master should see him go no more that way,
until he saw him carried to his burial.
His master asked the reason for his saying so.
He said he knew that he had taken the small-pox, and that he should die of that disease,
which accordingly came to pass about twelve days following.

He hearing his mother reading the first of Cor.
15:50, where the apostle Paul says,
"`Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,`"
he asked his father what he thought of that saying;
the father turned that question to his son, and asked his opinion of it; he replied,
as God was a spirit, that which was for his use, he would make it spiritual,
and therefore no longer flesh and blood.

When troubled with several questions about baptism,
he said he could prove from Eph. 4:5, that there was one Lord, one faith,
and one baptism; and he said, '`them that will be satisfied with that of water,
let them hold it; for my part, I depend nothing upon it.
I depend only upon the baptism of the spirit,
and I doubt there are many that talk most about baptism, know very little what it is.`'

He was taken sick, and about a quarter of an hour before he died he sat up in his bed,
his mother and sisters by him, and he asked what day of the week it was.
She told him, and he asked the hour of the day, the which she told; then he said,
'`Heaven is not far from me;`' his aunt asked him if
he was willing to leave his father and mother,
and all the world, to go to heaven; he said, '`Yes, I am;`' and further said,
'`It is a sweet change.`'
She desired the Lord to prepare him, and clear the way for him; he looking in her face,
said, '`I know the way, and who has cleared it.`'
And so died in peace, the 7th of the Third month, 1697,
in the twelfth year and seventh month of his age.

The dying words of THOMAS VOKINS, son of Richard and Joan Vokins, of West Charlow,
in the county of Berks.
The day before his departure he prayed thus: '`Oh! blessed God,
if it be your will to take me this night, make my passage easy; not my will be done;
your will be done.
Oh, Lord! you delivered Jacob out of all his troubles.`'

Another time he said, '`There is a good spirit as well as a bad spirit;
and if the good spirit be taken heed unto, it will be felt as strong to lead into good,
as the bad spirit is to lead into wickedness.`'
Not one hour before he died, his mother and others being present, he said, '`Mother,
the Lord is exceedingly good to me,
and has been all along the eight or nine weeks of my exercises,
and when I could hardly speak, his sweet presence has been with me,
and his life has sweetly refreshed me.`'

As his mother sat by him, she felt the power of the Lord,
and spoke to Friends in the chamber to be still,
and this innocent young man died like a lamb, without sigh or groan,
and those present felt the power of the Lord with him at his departure,
and were greatly refreshed; much was spoken by him of the goodness of the Lord,
but his voice being low, it could not well be heard.
He died the 23rd of the Second month, 1683.

RICHARD VOKINS, brother to the aforesaid Thomas Vokins, in the time of his sickness,
kept feeding in retirement within,
and when he first took his bed he examined himself before the Lord thus; saying, '`Lord,
have I done any thing to offend you, have I wronged any man?`'
and desiring the Lord would take off all reproach from his people.
During his sickness he was preserved in a quiet frame of mind,
no impatient words coming from him;
expressing how the Lord had preserved him in true simplicity,
which was his great comfort, and gave good advice to several who came to see him;
saying to them; '`It is well with me, you cannot think what I enjoy.`'
In the time of his health, he was a humble, tender-hearted man,
considerate of his servants and poor people that worked for him;
often saying that he would not enrich himself out of their labors;
and was glad when he could do good to any.
One time he called for his two children, and prayed the Lord to bless them;
his wife asked him, if it did not seem hard to part with them; to which he replied, '`No,
all is well, there is nothing troubles me,
all is well;`' desiring his dear children might take him for an example,
and live no worse a life than he had done.

After this, his wife said,
'`The Lord is able to raise you again if it be His will;`' he replied, '`I know he is able,
but he does not intend to restore me again;`' and
he told his doctor he could do him no good.
In the time of his sickness,
the impropriator and servants cleared his orchard of apples to the value of £4,
for tithes.
His wife asked if those people plundering them did not trouble him, he replied, '`No,
not at all, the Lord forgive them, they know not what they do.`'
When his wife perceived his speech to alter,
she again asked him if he was willing to leave the world; he replied, '`Yes,
very willing;`' soon after, his speech went quite away, and next day he died in peace,
being the 12th of the Eighth month, 1696.

ELIZABETH WILLS, daughter of Daniel and Mary Wills, of Northampton River, in West Jersey,
in America, was on the 2nd of Eighth month, 1687, visited with an ague and fever,
which continuing some days hard upon her, she often called upon the Lord, saying,
'`The Lord help me,
the Lord ease me;`' patiently begging of God for help in her great exercise,
and her cries were felt to proceed from the stirrings of life.
About the tenth hour of the sixth day of her sickness, her extremity being great,
she desired to be remembered to her mother,
who at that time was very ill in another chamber, and her mother understanding it,
she came to her, which much satisfied the child.
Turning to her mother, she embraced her, and said, '`O mother,
I will lie with you;`' and when she had manifested
her kindness and tender love to her mother,
for a little time lay still; there being her father and sister in the room,
she raised herself upright without help, and said,
'`Now I am well;`' giving living praises and thanksgiving to God, saying,
'`Lord God of power and glory; all power, glory and honor be given to you forever, Amen;
for you have helped me, you glorious God of life.
You have eased my heart, O you powerful God of glory; praises, and glory, and honor,
be given to you forever, Amen.
O you God of eternal glory! what shall I say unto you?
all praises be given unto your name, you glorious God of life, you have helped my soul;
praises forever be given unto you, forever, and forever.
Amen.`'
Often saying in this wise, '`What I speak,
God gives me to speak;`' and then speaking much more to the same effect,
all tending to the praise and glory of God,
and to the extolling of his great and wonderful name; often saying, '`God is good,
God has touched my heart.`'

Thus she remained praising and giving thanks to God for the space of an hour,
and it grew towards midnight.
Then she desired her two brothers, and her younger sister should be called,
who were in their beds, and when they came, she looked upon them,
but still remained praising and glorifying God, often saying, '`Now I am well,
I feel no pain.
I am willing to live; I am willing to die.
I am willing to leave the world, or I am willing to stay in the world;`' often saying,
'`I am content to live or to die;`' which expressions
greatly tendered the hearts of all present.
She again spoke much, praising and magnifying the great name of God,
to the same effect as before; several times saying, What I speak,
God gives me to speak;`' also saying,
'`I did not know God would have given me so much to speak,
for I was never sensible of these things before.`'
Then she took her father by the hand, and kissed him, saying, '`Farewell,
my dear father;`' and then took her mother by the hand, and kissed her, saying, '`Farewell,
my dear mother;`' and then her brothers, taking each of them by the hand,
and kissing them, saying, '`Farewell, my dear brothers;`' and lastly,
took her sisters by the hand, and kissed them, saying, '`Farewell, my dear sisters.`'
Her father hearing her use that expression to every one of them,
he called her by her name, saying, '`Where is that farewell you speak of?`'
she looked upon her father, and readily answered, saying, '`It is in my heart.`'

Her speech was so affecting, that it exceedingly tendered the hearts,
and caused tears to run much from the eyes, of all present; which she beholding,
as one without all sense of sorrow, looked upon her father, saying, '`Father,
you are troubled;`' he answered, no, he was not troubled, but glad;
saying it was more to him to behold her in that condition, than life, or length of days.
Then she said, '`I am well pleased.`'
She beholding her mother weeping, said, '`My mother is troubled;`' her mother answered,
saying, she was not troubled, but desired her to be content in the will of God.
Then she said, '`I am content.`'
She caused her brothers and sisters to speak their minds one by one,
of their satisfaction concerning her condition, which was done by them.
She hearing their sayings, was well satisfied; she often said,
as she was parting with them, '`God has eased me of my pain.`'
And after a little time she talked familiarly with them, as one that ailed nothing;
and in her discourse, spoke in this manner, saying,
'`James Martin (who was a minister of the gospel) is a good man; I would I could see him,
but he is gone to England; I shall see him no more; and John is a good man;`' her father,
standing by, asked her what John; and she said, '`that John who had a meeting in the barn,`'
(which was John Hayton); likewise she said, '`I shall see him no more.`'
She also said, '`Thomas Olive is a good man, and I shall see him tomorrow,
'`which accordingly she did.
When James Martin went away, she said, '`I am sure I cried;`' and said again,
'`Would I could see him.`'
Her father desired her to be satisfied, saying,
'`God has given you a share of that same life which
James has;`' so she mentioned him no more,
but something further of the goodness of God to her, and spoke of one Sarah Kem,
saying she was a good child, she died well.

She lay still, and after a little time her sense of pain came again,
and then she called upon the Lord, saying, '`The Lord help me,
the Lord ease me;`' and as it increased, the more earnestly she called upon the Lord,
saying, '`O Lord, how shall I ascend to you, that you may hear me?`'
And in time the Lord gave her some ease, and she took some rest; and the ninth day,
being the first day of the week, Friends coming to the meeting,
several came to see her before the meeting, unto whom she put forth her hand,
and tenderly asked several of them how they did;
but after meeting she seemed to be somewhat more weakened, and not so quick of memory,
but took her leave of several friends, as they came to her.`'

That day she several times inquired for a servant boy, who she knew to be negligent,
and often would lie out all night, and at the same time was gone,
and that night late he came again.
She desired to speak with him, so soon as she heard he was come.
When he came to her, she turned herself, and steadfastly looked upon him,
as one renewed with sense and strength, saying, '`God gave me much to speak last night,
and you were not here.
It is better for you that you shouldest walk with God.
You must die as well as I; you must go to the grave as well as I;
and if you do not do better you shall have torment, and I shall have peace.
It would be better for you that you wouldest walk with God, but time is past and gone,
and cannot be recalled.`'
Saying to him, '`Is it not better for you to do well than ill?`'
Her father standing by, asked her what she would have him to do then, if time were past.
She answered, she would have him do well, but she believed he would not;
she then said he might go away; and some time after called to him again, saying,
she would not have him forget what she had said to him.

On the 11th of the Eighth month, 1687, she departed this life,
having laid down her head in peace and rest with the Lord.

RICHARD PIKE, late of Cork, in Ireland, was born at Newbury, in England,
in or about the year 1627, and came from Ireland, belonging to the horse in the army,
which were sent from England, for the reduction of that nation,
upon the rebellion of the natives.
While he was in the army he had the character of a very sober, conscientious man,
but of great courage, for which he was much esteemed by his superior officers.
In those days he was accounted religiously inclined, and one who sought the Lord,
and the Lord was pleased to be found of him, and revealed his truth to him.
In or about the year 1655, the Lord sent some of his faithful ministers, called Quakers,
to that nation to preach the everlasting gospel,
by whom he was convinced of the way of life and salvation,
to which he became truly obedient,
and soon denied the use of carnal weapons for the destruction of mankind;
and in other things taking up the cross of Christ, despising the shame,
and for truth`'s sake became a great sufferer, by patiently enduring reproaches,
abuses and imprisonments, as well as loss of outward substance.
As he was a faithful follower of the Lord Jesus,
so he was greatly beloved by all faithful friends who knew him; and his deportment,
conduct and commerce among the world, were such as adorned the blessed truth,
being a very upright and just, as well as a very inoffensive man;
insomuch that his greatest persecutors have been heard to say,
if there were any good or honest men among the Quakers, he was one.

In the year 1668 he was, with several friends more, cast into prison by one Rye,
then mayor of Cork, for meeting together to worship God;
in which place he got a violent cold, which ended in a flux, that brought him very low,
the prison being thronged, and without convenience at that time for the sick.
The jailor indulged him for a little time to be a prisoner in his own house.
After his coming home, the distemper increasing upon him,
brought him exceedingly weak and low; though in much pain, yet very patient under it,
and much retired to the Lord, and in a sweet frame of spirit.
The Fifth-day before he died came that worthy mother in Israel, Susannah Mitchel,
to visit him; who, sitting in silent waiting upon the Lord by his bedside,
was moved to pray, which she did with great fervency of spirit.
At which time also the power of the Lord fell upon him in a wonderful manner,
greatly melting and tendering his spirit,
causing him to give forth several sweet and heavenly expressions;
and though he was exceedingly weak in body,
and neither able nor fit to rise out of bed before,
yet the presence and power of the Lord so strengthened him,
that he immediately rose out of his bed, as one that ailed little,
and put on his clothes, in order to go to the prison,
to see and meet his dear companions and fellow-sufferers.
His wife and friends present, seeing this great and sudden alteration;
were in great hopes the Lord would restore him to his health again.

He went abroad to prison, as one that was not sick,
and had a good meeting with Friends there;
the jailor gave him leave in the evening to return home again, which he did,
with little appearance of illness; but soon after his return,
as one that was only raised from his deathbed to
give his last visit to his beloved friends,
his distemper returned again, and he grew exceedingly ill that night,
and so continued growing worse till about the Third-day, in the evening,
at which time he was so bad that it was concluded he was dying.
In his weak conditions the power of the Lord came
upon him again in an extraordinary manner,
so that he was revived, and as one that had new life and strength given him,
and he spoke of the wonderful love of God to his soul, and the preciousness of truth,
with seasonable exhortation to all that were about him.
Thus he continued with the Lord`'s power upon him until the Fifth-day, whereon he died;
having a spirit of discerning given him from the Lord,
by which he saw and spoke directly to the inward states
and conditions of most or all that came to visit him,
giving counsel and advice accordingly, and in particular to some who had been unfaithful.
He spoke so home to their states, that they were almost amazed,
warning them to prize their time, and be more faithful for the time to come.

He also called those of his children who were come to some years of understanding,
in particular Joseph, Elizabeth, and Ebenezer Pike,
and gave them heavenly advice and counsel; and among the rest,
he spoke to them to this purpose: '`Fear the Lord, and be faithful to him,
and be obedient to your mother, and then the Lord will be a father to you,
and provide for and bless you, and the rest of you every day,
and let the blessing of your dying father rest upon
you;`' with more that cannot now be remembered.
It would require a volume to contain the many blessed and heavenly sayings and exhortations,
if they could be remembered, which came from him in the time of his sickness,
especially the last two days of his life, some of which were taken from his mouth,
and committed to writing by a friend present, and read at his burial;
which paper is through some neglect mislaid or lost.

He quietly departed this life, and died in the Lord, the Fourth month, 1668,
being about forty-one years of age.

THOMAS THOMPSON, of Skipsea,
was convinced of the truth of God by that ancient
and faithful minister of the gospel of Christ,
William Dewsbury, in the Eighth month of the year 1652,
and shortly after had his mouth opened to declare the name of the Lord,
and preach repentance to the people.
He was preserved in faithfulness to the truth to the end of his days,
not turning his back from sufferings, but patiently endured reproach for Christ`'s sake,
and spoiling of goods, with many years`' imprisonment.
When it pleased the Lord to visit him with the illness whereof he died,
which began on the 26th day of the Sixth month, 1704,
his heart was filled with the love of God,
and he was enabled through the goodness of God, though very weak in body,
to go to several meetings, in which the Lord`'s heavenly power did livingly attend him.
On the sixth day of the Seventh month, he was at the monthly meeting held at Harpham,
being the last public meeting he was at,
where he bore a plain and powerful testimony to the ancient truth,
laboring to encourage all Friends to be faithful to God,
and to be diligent in the service of truth, according to their several abilities, gifts,
and endowments,
that so an increase of the peaceable government of Christ might be witnessed,
both in the particular and also in the general.

He was indeed a laborious man in the work of the gospel,
having travelled in truth`'s service several times through Scotland,
and in many places in this nation; and, as he said when upon a dying-bed,
for many years had not omitted any opportunity of being serviceable.
His testimony was plain, but powerful; sound and convincing,
and severe against wickedness;
but to the young and tender-hearted he was very loving and affectionate,
even as a nurse that cherishes her children.
On the tenth day of the month, in the year aforesaid, being the First day of the week,
several Friends visited him in his chamber, he being then very weak,
to whom he declared the lovingkindness of God, and of his tender dealings with his soul,
from his youth to that day; and that he felt the Lord,
who had been the guide of his youth, to be the staff of his old age;
and exhorted Friends to faithfulness and confidence in God,
that they should depend upon the arm of his power and providence forever.

On the 13th day of the month, several Friends being with him,
he said that he was content to live or die, as the Lord pleased, in whom he had peace;
and that he was in no doubt concerning his salvation, but was satisfied forever,
and could say with Job, the Lord had granted him life and favor,
and his visitations still preserved his spirit.
The next day, being the 14th, and the day of his departure out of this world,
he spoke little in the forenoon, being under much bodily weakness and pain at times;
but about the second or third hour in the afternoon, in a heavenly, melting manner,
he said, '`The Lord is my portion, and the lot of my inheritance forever.
I am not dismayed;`' and after a little time,
'`I have peace with God;`' and after a considerable pause,
'`Since the day that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, As you are converted,
strengthen your brethren; and if you love me, feed my lambs; I have spared no pains,
either in body or spirit,
neither am I conscious to myself of slipping any
opportunity of being serviceable to truth and Friends;
but have gone through what was before me with all willingness possible.
And now I feel the love of God,
and the returns of peace in my bosom;`' which words were
spoken in so living a sense of God`'s heavenly power,
that it wonderfully broke and tendered Friends present.

Another time he said, '`The Lord Jesus Christ has shed his precious blood for us,
and laid down his life, and became sin for us,
that we might be made the righteous of God in him.
O, this is love indeed.`'
Again he said, '`My heart is filled with the love of God.
Oh the excellency! oh the glory! oh how glorious and excellent
is the appearance of God! the rays of his glory fill his tabernacle:`'
and so he sung melodiously, saying, '`O praises, praises, high praises,
and hallelujah to the King of Zion, who reigns gloriously this day.`'
All which being spoken in a heavenly sense of the aboundings
of the sweet life of the divine and living Word,
which was with the Father in the beginning,
mightily overcame and melted the spirits of Friends.
To a neighbor who came in to see him, he said, '`We must put off these mortal bodies;
but for them that fear the Lord there is an immortal one prepared.`'
He continued very cheerful and sensible to the last,
and spoke very cheerfully to several neighbors who came to see him.
About three quarters of an hour before his death,
he spoke to one that had been under convincement several years,
but had not been faithful,
exhorting him to repent and be faithful to what God had manifested to him,
that so he might find mercy; with many more words not remembered,
telling him that he would find it a terrible thing to appear before an angry God.
He said that he spoke to him in love, and would have him take it so;
and bade him remember the words of a dying man, and so bade him farewell.

Another time he said to friends, '`You are my witnesses,
that I have not withheld from you the counsel and mind of God,
and have labored to provoke you to faithfulness and diligence in his service,
that so you might receive a crown of glory at the hand of the Lord,
which is laid up in store for all the righteous,
and my conscience is clear in God`'s sight.`'
Being filled with the living power and love of God,
he often praised his holy and glorious name;
and about the seventh hour he passed away like a lamb, into his Father`'s bosom,
without so much as either sigh or groan, and is at rest in the Lord forevermore.

He departed this life in the seventy-third year of his age,
the 14th of the Seventh month, 1704.
A laborer in the gospel about fifty years.

The testimony of HUGH STAMPER, of Lurgan, in Ireland,
near his departure out of this life.

About twenty friends being present, he said,

[.embedded-content-document]
--

I die in the same faith that I have made profession of, and lived in,
and suffered for these twenty-three years, and I am as willing to die as to live.
All the desire I have to live, is to see truth prosper, and if sufferings come,
I am willing to suffer for it.
There is no weight or burden lies at my door.
I have wronged no man, neither have I been burdensome to any,
but always if there was any difference, I suffered wrong for peace-sake.
I have not oppressed any man.
So, my dear friends, beware of oppression, walk in love one to another,
passing by infirmities, forgiving one another, for even as Christ said,
if you forgive not one another, how shall your heavenly Father forgive you?
Even as he who would not forgive his brother, missed of pardon.
Keep your hearts clean, and let no rottenness remain therein.
Keep the heart void of offense towards God and man, and when any evil does appear,
judge it down with the light, and be not peevish, nor fretting;
it hinders the springs of life.
Walk humbly before your God, and be of a pure mind to him,
Walk in true love one towards another, and stand not at a distance one from another,
for envy and strife lead from God, and eat as a canker,
so miss of the blessing which is poured down upon the righteous,
as showers of latter rain.
Blessed be the Lord God forever.
Bear up your heads, and give not away your crowns for any visible thing here below,
for they are but trifles, and things of no value.
Dear friends, keep your crowns sure, and then you need not care what scoffers, mockers,
liars, backbiters, and drunkards say, for their way leads to hell,
and they cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven.

Dear friends, in the suffering of all things, you shall come to wear the crown.
No cross, no crown; take notice of that.
Friends, keep your crown, that your bow may abide in full strength in the needful time,
when the pains of death come upon you, which will come upon all in due time.
Death troubles me not, for blessed be the Lord forever,
the enemy dared never so much as once set up his head, either to twist or twine;
since I lay on this my bed of sickness, there is nothing but peace on every side.

My dear friends, I desire you in the bowels of tender love to love one another,
and you will be a comely people, and an honor to God and one to another.
Bear the daily cross, that you may be crowned when time shall be no more,
and come to partake of the mercies of David, namely,
an everlasting covenant which has no end.
If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the wicked and ungodly appear?
Oh! the joy and endless felicity that shall be upon the righteous,
and what horror and misery shall be upon the wicked!

And, dear friends, let not a bare profession serve your turn,
for it will not stand you in any stead in such a needful time as this,
but walk answerably to what you profess, that your bow may stand in full strength,
as mine does at this time.
Blessed be the name of the Lord forever, I have no more lying upon me that I know of,
to hinder my journey, than a child.
So, my dear friends, do not will and run in your own wills, but wait daily upon the Lord,
and let your whole dependence be upon him, that you may come in at the right door,
for whosoever climbs up another way is a thief and a robber.
Cast your care upon the Lord, and he will in no wise cast you off,
but he will work in you, and for you, and you will become the children of the day,
and of the light.
I do not speak these things to exalt myself, for there is no exalting in the grave,
but I must bear my testimony for God, and for his truth.
Friends, you know these things before;
this is to stir up your minds to stand steadfast in the truth,
and let not your crown be taken from you.
Be faithful in the day of small things, and despise them not,
and the Lord will make you rulers over much, so shall you be honorable men and women,
and he will shower down multitudes of blessings upon your heads.

O friends, I desire you again not to slight this glorious day, which is now dawned,
for it can be called no less than salvation upon earth,
but walk faithfully to the receiving of your crown,
and you will return with sheaves in your bosoms.

--

Thus often exhorting Friends to faithfulness, and to be of an honest heart,
and to keep nothing there but that which is of a right nature, saying,
'`Take notice of my words, for they are the words of a dying man,
and they are very weighty; and if you will not hear,
you shall be made to remember hereafter when I am gone.`'

When the time of his departure came near, he said, '`Come Lord Jesus,
come when it is your blessed will, for I am ready for you.`'
Just before he died he sat up in his bed and spoke these words, '`Now, Lord Jesus,
receive my soul into your everlasting kingdom of glory,
for your kingdom is from everlasting to everlasting;`' and
so departed this life about the ninth of the Seventh month,
1676.
Aged about sixty-five years.

REUBEN SATTERTHWAITE, born at Skinerhow, in the parish of Hawkshead,
in the county of Lancaster, came of believing parents,
who used a godly care in educating him in the way
of truth as professed by the people called Quakers.
This young man had a care over his own words and actions, that they might become truth,
and he received a gift of the ministry about the twenty-third year of his age,
wherein he did much improve himself until the twenty-sixth year of his age,
wherein he died; in which time he faithfully labored in the gospel.
He travelled into Scotland in company with his friend George Knipe,
who was a nursing father to him,
and they visited every meeting of Friends in that nation.
Being clear of that nation, he came back through Northumberland bishopric,
and the east parts of Yorkshire, and so home: and in the Second month of the year 1694,
he with his said friend set forward for London, and was at the yearly meeting there,
and afterwards visited Friends in the west of England,
even to the Land`'s-end in Cornwall, and so back by Bristol.
In this journey he had very good success,
and was much enlarged in his gift of the ministry;
and from Bristol travelled through Wales to Lancashire home again.
He travelled into Derbyshire, Nottingham and Lincolnshire; and in the Third month, 1696,
again into Scotland with his former friend, George Knipe,
and returned from there through Cumberland, which was the last journey he had,
for he was removed out of this troublesome world the same year.

He was a good example and pattern in righteousness and holiness,
and was valiant for the truth upon earth, and was of a sound mind,
and preached sound doctrine, and often opened the Holy Scriptures,
to the edification of the hearers.
When he was visited with sickness, he bore it patiently, and in the first part,
he got up and walked about the house, but feeling himself weak in body, he said,
'`I am a poor mortal, a worm, and dust and ashes.`'
Though his body was weakened and decayed, yet he was strengthened inwardly,
and often spoke of the kind dealings of the Lord with him,
and how mercifully he had helped him in his travels.
His sickness increasing he kept his bed, and many came to visit him;
to whose conditions he spoke, to the admiration of those about him.
Not long before he died, his sister-in-law being present, he said, '`Oh!
Lord, you know I have passed through many exercises for your name`'s sake,
and you have rewarded me well for the same, for which I praise your holy name.
The Lord God is my staff, as he was to David, who said his staff did comfort him.`'

Some young friends visiting him, he said,
'`I desire you to wait upon the Lord all your days, for the promise of the Lord is to you,
if you will wait upon him,
and love him to the end;`' with more expressions that could not be remembered.
He passed that night in a very good frame of spirit, breathing to the Lord.
On the morrow, being the First-day of the week, several young people came in,
to whose conditions he spoke distinctly,
exhorting them to remember their Creator in the days of their youth.
He was very weak in body, but his words did so affect them,
that they were tendered and broken into tears,
and several Friends present were much comforted thereby.
That night, Margaret his sister, and another Friend sitting up with him,
he taking his sister by the hand, said, '`Dear sister,
tell my father and mother that I must go, I must go home.`'
After some sight which he had, which brought some exercise upon him,
he broke forth into an inward rejoicing of spirit;
and after that he expressed the travail that was upon his mind
for some Friends and meetings in parts which he had visited,
and prayed to the Lord to be gracious and merciful to them,
and spoke many more seasonable words that are not here mentioned.
That same night he departed this life, being the 12th of the Eleventh month, 1696.

JOSHUA BUNION, who lived near Ipswich in Suffolk in England,
went over to preach the gospel in Ireland in the year 1696.
He was remarkable for his extraordinary innocency in his conduct,
chiefly minding the discharge of his duty, with respect to his ministry,
which was edifying.
He was taken sick going from Dublin to the north of Ireland,
and coming to Ballyhagan in the county of Armagh,
was so weak that he could scarcely alight off his horse without help,
yet his zeal was such that he bore a faithful testimony
for truth in the public meeting the same day.
Afterwards he went to bed, continuing very ill about two weeks.
In the time of his sickness he was very fervent in prayer, and the day before he died,
sitting in a chair, desired another to be set before him, on which he leaned,
and prayed fervently and powerfully to the Lord.
The next day he departed this life, the 23rd of the Fourth month, 1696.
Aged about forty years.
He was buried in Friends`' burying-place, near Ballyhagan aforesaid.

PETER FLETCHER was born near Pardsay, in Cumberland, in England,
and educated in the profession of truth.
He came over to be an apprentice in Dublin;
and after he had served his apprenticeship he settled in the said city;
he was of good conduct, both in respect to his Christian duty towards God,
in duly attending meetings for the worship of God, and other religious performances,
and ready and cheerful in doing those offices of love which we owe one unto another.
About three years before his death the Lord was pleased to call him into the ministry;
in which he was sound and deliberate in his delivery,
being careful to minister from that ability which God had given him.
He was under weakness of body some months before his death,
in which time he spoke of the Lord`'s dealings with him,
and how he inclined his heart to seek him when he was young,
and had kept him all along to that day,
in a sense of his goodness and power which had preserved him.
He was freely given up to the Lord`'s disposing,
and rather willing to leave the world than stay any longer therein,
if it were the Lord`'s will;
and further said he found nothing but sweet peace to abound in his heart from the Lord;
and so being prepared for his latter end, he departed this life in Dublin,
the 29th of the Fourth month, 1698.
Aged about thirty years.

ABRAHAM FULLER was convinced of the truth in or about the year 1660,
being about the forty-first year of his age.
He lived most of his time after his convincement at Lyhensa in King`'s county;
he feared the Lord,
and was a serviceable man on several accounts in the church of Christ,
and bore a testimony for the truth, and was a free and open-hearted man to his friends,
distributing of his substance unto those that were in necessity.
He was taken sick about the beginning of the Eighth month, 1694, of an ague and cholic.

In the time of his sickness he expressed his concern for the prosperity of truth,
and sent to speak with some that made profession of it,
and did not walk answerably thereto, and did admonish them to repent,
and amend their lives.
He was often in his illness in supplication to the Lord,
and in returning praises to him for his mercies which he had received from him.
About the 4th day of the Ninth month, most of his children being about him,
and sitting awhile in silence, he then prayed the Lord that he would bless his children,
and preserve them from the evils that were in the world.

One day having a pretty sharp fit of the ague upon him,
his daughter-in-law who attended him said, '`Father,
the fit you had yesterday went away easily;`' he replied, '`Yes,
the Lord`'s power took the pain away.`'
He gave his children good counsel and admonition,
according as he had a sense of their states.
He often in the time of his illness expressed how good the Lord was to him.
Six days before his death, being gone to his bed at night,
he desired to speak with his children that were in the house,
there being two of his sons and his son`'s wife.
After they had sat a little time silent by his bedside,
he said he had a desire to let them know,
that if the Lord had no further service for him to do, he was willing to die;
and then spoke to one of his sons, giving him good advice;
and then called to his other son by name, and said,
'`The Lord make you a sanctified vessel fit for his use.`'

His eldest son, living nearly a mile off, being newly recovered from a fit of sickness,
came to see his father, and when he was about to take leave of him,
which was but about two hours before his death, he spoke to him,
admonishing him to take care of his soul, for it was of great value.
He desired several times in his sickness,
if it were the Lord`'s will that he might be sensible at his departure,
and have an easy passage.
His desire was answered, for in less than a quarter of an hour before his death,
he laid his hand on the bedside, and turned himself,
and desired to be a little raised in his bed; and so departed quietly,
and finished his course about the twelfth hour at night, on the 4th of the Tenth month,
at his son Isaac`'s house at Lismina, and was buried at Friends`' burial-place,
at the Moat a Green.

ROBERT BARCLAY, of Urie, in Scotland.
This worthy man of God, whose character is written,
as well for their example and encouragement who have
or hereafter may receive the eternal truth,
in which he lived and died, and lives forever,
as for a testimony to the power and goodness of God, in raising him up to his church,
and to his lasting memorial in the churches of Christ, which is blessed forever.
The said Robert Barclay was the son of Colonel David Barclay,
descended of the Barclays of Mathers, in the kingdom of Scotland,
an ancient and honorable family among men, and Katherine Gordon,
from the Gordons of the house of the duke of Gordon.
He was born at Edinburgh, in 1648, educated in France,
and had the advantage of that tongue as well as the Latin.

He returned to Scotland about 1664, being sixteen years of age, where,
by the example and instruction of his honest and worthy father,
who in his absence had received the everlasting truth,
and his conversation was with other servants of God,
he came to see and taste an excellency in it,
and was convinced thereof about the year 1667.
He publicly owned the testimony of the true light, enlightening every man,
and came early forth a zealous and fervent witness for it, enduring the cross,
and despising the shame that attended his discipleship,
and received the gift of the ministry as his greatest honor,
in which he labored to bring others to God, and his labor was not in vain in the Lord.
He was much exercised in controversy, from the many contradictions that fell upon truth,
and upon him for its sake, in his own country chiefly,
in which he ever acquitted himself with honor to the truth,
particularly by his Apology for the Christian divinity
professed by the people called Quakers,
which contains a collection of our principles, our enemies`' objections,
and our answers augmented and illustrated closely and amply,
with many authorities for confirmation.
He wrote several other books which are printed,
and make a volume of nigh two hundred and thirty sheets,
which contain many standing books of sound judgment,
and good service to the truth and church of God.

He travelled often in Scotland and England, and also in Holland and Germany,
to spread the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He loved the truth, and the way of God, as revealed among the people called Quakers,
above the world, and was not ashamed of it before men,
but bold and able in maintaining it, sound in judgment, strong in argument,
cheerful in travails and sufferings, of a pleasant disposition, yet solid and plain,
and exemplary in his conduct.
He was a learned man, a good Christian, an able minister, a dutiful son,
a loving husband, a tender and careful father, an easy master,
and a good and kind neighbor and friend.
These eminent qualities in one who had employed them so serviceably,
and who had not lived much above half the life of a man,
having outlived his father but four years,
and died at least thirty years short of his age, aggravate the loss of him.

His sickness was short: our friend James Dickinson, of Cumberland,
in his travel into that nation, visiting him when on his deathbed, as he sat by him,
the Lord`'s power and presence bowing their hearts together,
Robert Barclay was sweetly melted in the sense of God`'s love,
and with tears expressed his love to all faithful brethren in England,
who keep their integrity to the truth.
He added, '`Remember my love to Friends in Cumberland, and at Swarthmore,
and to dear George,`' meaning George Fox, '`and to all the faithful everywhere;`' and said,
'`God is good still,
and though I am under great weight of sickness and weakness as to my body,
yet my peace flows; and this I know, whatever exercises may be permitted to come upon me,
it shall tend to God`'s glory, and my salvation, and in that I rest.`'

He died at his own house in Urie, in Scotland, the third day of the Eighth month, 1690,
leaving behind him seven children, four sons and three daughters.

He was born 1648; convinced of truth 1667; wrote his first book for truth 1670;
and his notable Apology in and about the 27th year of his age, 1675.
He died in the forty-second year of his age.

HANNAH TURNER, daughter of Thomas Turner, of Coggeshall, in the county of Essex,
in visiting her acquaintance, was taken sick at Goussingbeckingham-hall,
in the said county, and quickly after being taken sick was sensible she should die.
Her mother being with her, she desired her to bear it with patience,
and remember how it was with Abraham, and with many in our day,
in parting with their only child.
'`Dear mother, consider, it may be this great trial may prove to our sanctification;
bear it with patience.`'
For several days she lay in a composed state, praying to the Lord to forgive her offenses.
She was troubled that she was so far from her friends and neighbors,
and would have been glad to see them.
She expressed her concern for an acquaintance of hers,
entreating her mother to say to her as follows: '`Consider my death as a precedent,
and remember she must come before the bar of the great God, as well as I,
and can no way shun it; and how does she think to stand there without great repentance.`'

Another time she desired to have her love remembered to Friends at London,
and ordered the manner of her burial.
Her father coming off a journey to see her, she said, '`Dear father,
how often have I been comforted to consider how the Lord
has preserved you through many jeopardies of your life,
both by sea and land.`'
She also admonished her nurse not to go into mirth and pastime,
nor be ashamed of the cross of Christ.
'`What if people mock you, be not ashamed; remember Solomon`'s words,
that "`know for all these things God will bring you into
judgment.`"`' Many other exhortations she gave to this lass,
saying, '`Take notice of what I say;`' to which she answered, breaking forth into weeping,
'`I hope I shall.`'
At other times she spoke several weighty and seasonable exhortations,
which are not taken down, and so passed away, inwardly breathing to the Lord,
which was a great comfort to those with her;
and died on the 8th day of the Twelfth month, 1705, in the nineteenth year of her age.

THOMAS UPSHER was born in the parish of Lexden, in the borough of Colchester,
in the county of Essex, and was sprinkled or baptized, as they call it, a few days after,
according to the manner of the church of England, the 11th of the Sixth month, 1672,
but was educated in the Presbyterian way, and was religiously inclined from his youth,
often seeking the Lord for the good of his soul,
and delighted in reading the Holy Scriptures.
About the fourteenth year of his age he left the Presbyterians,
and joined himself with the people called the General Baptists,
and was zealous in that way, and became a preacher among them when young,
and was well esteemed by them,
until it pleased the Lord more effectually to visit him by the light of Jesus Christ,
unto which he turned his heart,
and came to see the emptiness of his former professions and talk of religion,
without the knowledge of God and Christ by the revelation of the Spirit.

A few days after he was convinced of truth, he wrote a letter,
which was sent to the Baptist meeting, to be read on the first day of the week,
showing the cause why he left them.
This letter was dated the 13th of the Ninth month, 1692,
so that he was twenty years of age when he came among the people called Quakers,
and was a diligent attender of the meetings of that people for the worship of God,
waiting upon him in silence and retirement of mind, for his teaching and counsel,
until he was pleased to give him a gift in the ministry,
which he received in great humility, and entered upon his ministry,
in speaking a few words among Friends, in much fear and tenderness,
to the comfort and refreshment of many.
God in tender mercy did increase his gift,
so that he became an able minister of the gospel,
to the turning of many from darkness to the light of Christ Jesus;
and in that service he travelled in most parts of England, and also in Ireland.

As he often in the time of his health remembered and spoke of his death,
so he did in his sickness, saying, '`I do not expect to live long in this world.
I have been preparing for a better.
I do not desire to live here on my own account.
I long more and more to be at home with my God,
yet I would not be of that sort to desire my reward before my work is done.
There is nothing here can invite my stay,
but if God has further service for me in this world,
I am resigned and given up to his will.`'

In a letter to a particular friend, written in the time of his sickness,
he expressed himself in these words:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

When I consider those many unaccountable changes which we, and ours,
and all we have in this world are subject to,
it seems a sufficient antidote against the inordinate love of it, and it appears to me,
that it is the lack of due thoughtfulness which makes many so much engaged in it,
as almost wholly to sequester all those religious endeavors which
are really necessary to make sure of an eternal interest.

It is now a long time since I have enjoyed one day of perfect health as heretofore.
I consider it as a preparatory summons from this frail state of life; and to conclude,
I thank God I am not altogether unmindful of my duty,
in setting my house in order against the time shall come that I must die, and not live.
I hope to live in a far better state,
and there to enjoy all the generations of the just that are gone before,
and shall hereafter follow.

--

About the same time, several Friends being with him, he, speaking of his death,
desired they might bear him witness, saying, '`My dependence, hope, and trust,
is only and alone in the Lord Jesus Christ,
and that I do not value myself upon any qualification or endowment,
but lay all down at the feet of Jesus, and am as nothing before him.`'
About two days after, though weak in body, he was carried in a coach to Ipswich,
to the burial of a Friend.
When he came there, he seemed very unfit for the service of the day,
there being much people at the burial; but the Lord strengthened him to declare,
as at other times, the truth and word of life for about an hour and a half,
which much affected the people in general; and Friends, who knew his weakness of body,
admired the love and goodness of God to him.
He prayed also, and spoke at the grave some time,
and appeared stronger after the meeting than before,
and continued better a few days after.
But his sickness returned again, and he was very patient under the extreme pains,
which he said no tongue could express, desiring to be resigned;
and the Lord blessed him with resignation, faith, and patience, under all.

To a Friend that came to visit him,
who made some observation of the prevalence of his distemper, he said, '`Now,
in all likelihood, I am about to take my last leave of you all,
and I pray God from my heart to bless you.`'
Many sound expressions were spoken to those who visited him in his sickness; to some,
counsel and advice; to others, his own experience of the mercy and goodness of God.
Being desired to send for another physician, he answered, '`No, I am satisfied:
if God had been pleased to have said amen to means,
there has been sufficient means used for my recovery,
and therefore I shall have my eye only to the Lord for help.`'
At another time he said,
'`My tongue is not able to express what I feel of the love
and goodness of God now when I have most need of it;
that saying used by that plain, despised people is very true,
that life is better than words.
There is one thing I cannot find out,
why the Lord should so abound in his love and mercy to me,
who am unworthy of the least of his mercies.`'

There was a great refreshment felt many times in being with him in silence,
in time of his sickness.
On a First day, in the morning, several Friends being in his chamber,
he desired that they might wait upon the Lord together;
and the Lord was pleased to open his mouth to praise his holy name.
Although very weak in bed,
some Friends desiring him to say little to those who came to visit him, his answer was,
'`I know not whether I may have another opportunity to do it.`'
He remembered the faithful, and spoke of their blessed estate; at the sight of which,
he was even as it were in a rapture of joy,
praising the Lord to the comfort of those present, saying,
'`Oh! that I might declare of the wonders of the Lord that I have seen in the deeps,
but I am resigned to the will of the Lord.`'
His pains and exercises were very great, and, as he often said, unknown;
yet he also said, '`The Lord is very good to me,
and bears up my spirit in the midst of them all.`'
Taking leave of several friends who visited him, he said, '`Oh! that you may so live,
that we may meet again in the mansions of eternal rest.`'
He remembered his dear love to friends everywhere, saying, '`They are near my life,
I have true unity with them in spirit.`'
At another meeting in his chamber, about fourteen days before he died,
the state of the church, and many precious truths were opened to him,
and in a heavenly frame of spirit he spoke of the wonderful wisdom, love,
and goodness of God,
exhorting Friends to be more faithful and diligent in the service of the Lord.

About ten days before his death, finding himself, as he thought, somewhat better,
he went to the meeting, being the First-day of the week,
and prayed fervently in the forenoon meeting, praising the name of the Lord,
in a true sense of his mercy and goodness.
But in a day or two he altered much, his distemper prevailing upon him.
He desired to be carried decently to his grave, saying, '`I love decency,
and desire to die in great humiliation,
and commit my spirit into the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ.`'
About the time of his death, he was in a heavenly frame of spirit,
and spoke of a glorious meeting, and said,
'`The Lord in the riches of his mercy will keep all them that trust in him,
under all their trials to the end.`'
And so departed this life, the 10th of the Eighth month, 1704.
Aged thirty-two years two months.
He left behind him three children; and his wife, in the time of his sickness,
was much indisposed, which was an addition to his exercise.

PRISCILLA CUTHBERT, born at Brentford, in Middlesex, in 1697,
was the daughter of Thomas and Isabella Cuthbert, of the same place.
Some months before her sickness,
she was observed to have a religious concern upon her mind,
and retired from the rest of the children, and denied herself diversions among them,
and got into solitary places, and read in good books, and sometimes weeping by herself,
and other times praising the Lord.
She had a sight of her death before she sickened, and spoke of it to several.
When her sickness came, which continued three weeks, she bore it with much patience,
praying to the Lord to be her comfort, and said,
'`I hope the Lord will comfort my dear father and mother;`' acknowledging the labor
and tender care and cost which her parents had been at for her bringing up,
and the education of herself and sisters and brothers.
When her father came to her, upon her inquiry after him,
she laid her arms about his face to wipe off the tears, and said, '`Lord,
comfort my father and mother, and bless my poor sisters,
and my brothers;`' and gave good advice to her brother to obey his parents,
and fear the Lord, saying he will bless you.
She said to her father, '`I am willing to live to praise the Lord,
and I am willing to die, if it were at this moment of time.`'
She desired that when she was buried, none that laughed or were vain should be there,
but such as feared the Lord; and in a sweet frame of mind praised the Lord.

Another time she said, '`I have, in the time of my health,
been afraid when I have seen any dead nailed up in their coffins;
but now the Lord has taken away that fear, blessed be his name.
Therefore take you notice, who stand by me,
that I am neither afraid of death nor the grave,
but I am willing to die when it pleases the Lord;`' and soon after fell asleep.
She often prayed for her parents,
to whom she expressed more than ordinary affection
and regard for their love and tenderness to her,
expressing her willingness to die, and her comfort in the Lord.
Her school-mistress visiting her, she said,
'`I am going where I trust in the Lord I shall have rest, for the Lord is my rest.`'
Near her end, her father speaking of his purpose to stay with her that night,
she replied, '`No, no, for I shall not die this night,
though it will not be long before I do.`'
He went to bed: and the next day her father coming to her,
she having had some rest in the night, she praised the Lord;
a neighbor present supposed she might, by her praising God, disturb her father,
to which she made no answer, till after some time, she said,
'`Is my father disturbed at my praising the Lord?
no, no, I know he is not.
Indeed if I was dying, as some have done of late, rending and tearing with bad words,
my father and mother too would have great reason to be troubled,
but to have a child die in the Lord, I hope great is their comfort.
I know their trouble is mixed with joy,
blessed be the Lord for it;`' upon these words several
young women present broke forth into tears.

About two hours before she died,
her father asked her if he and her mother should
turn her to see if she could have a little rest,
she answered, '`Do what you please.`'
A friend present advised all to be quiet and still,
and in a little time hearing one weep, she said, '`Who is that, my sister Elizabeth?`'
reply was made, no; she replied, '`For the Lord`'s sake do not cry for me,
do not cry for me.`'
These were the last words she was heard to speak:
and so departed this life without sigh or groan,
about the ninth hour of the sixth day of the Sixth month, 1701,
in the fourteenth year of her age.

ELIZABETH WHIDDON, wife of Henry Whiddon, of Cork, in Ireland;
was from her childhood given to sobriety, beyond what was common in one of her years,
when she was about fourteen years of age,
and was a woman of an exemplary life and conduct.
She was called of the Lord to give testimony to his name and truth,
though she was backward and unwilling to be concerned in so weighty a work,
yet afterwards grew more strong, and declared of the wonderful things of God.

In the time of her sickness she enjoyed a great refreshment
from the presence of the Lord,
which tendered the hearts of friends present,
and caused her to praise and magnify the God of her salvation,
some days before her death.

Her brother, Joseph Pike, visiting her one morning, and inquiring how she did, she said,
'`Oh! dear brother, though I have not slept all this night,
yet I am as one that needs it not.
Though my body is extraordinarily weak, yet I am strong,
the power of the Lord carrying me over all weakness; but above all,
the Lord said this night to me, in the powerful and fresh openings of life,
"`You shall praise me in the heavens;`" which has so overcome my soul,
and raised my spirits, that I am as one that lacks no sleep,
nor is sensible of pain or weakness;`' and so went on in praising and magnifying the Lord,
with many good expressions that cannot well be remembered.
About a day before she died, observing her sister Elizabeth Allen to weep,
looking upon her with a composed countenance, she said, '`Sister, why do you weep?`'
She answered, because unwilling to part with her.
She replied, '`Oh!
I shall go to everlasting joy and felicity, where I shall be at rest.`'

She departed this life the 23rd day of the Fifth month, 1693,
to receive the recompense of reward, even a crown eternal,
of which she had received before-hand a full assurance.

ROBERT SANDHAM, born near Petworth, in Sussex, in England,
was convinced very early of truth at Youghall, in Ireland, where he then dwelt,
and he soon became a faithful follower of it, and sufferer for it,
bearing a steadfast testimony to it against its opposers;
and was a preacher of it in his life and conduct among
the inhabitants of that town until the end of his days.
He lay sick two weeks,
in which time he often exhorted Friends that came
to visit him to be faithful to the truth;
and to some, negligent therein, he said much in warning them to be no longer so,
but to hasten out of a lukewarm state, lest the portion thereof should be theirs.
Some relations and neighbors visiting him, he exhorted them to receive the truth; '`For,`'
said he, '`I bear my testimony now on my dying-bed,
that it is the truth which the Quakers profess;
therefore be faithful to the Lord and his truth, while you have health and strength,
and delay not till you come to a dying-bed, as too many are apt to do,
for then oftentimes men and women find it enough to bear their
sickness and pains;`' which affected most present.

To his wife, with whom he had lived about twenty-four years in much love, he said,
'`I am freely given up to the Lord`'s will.
I therefore desire you also to give up, and bear my death with patience,
and the Lord will make up your loss of me in being near unto you.`'
He often exhorted his children to love the Lord and his truth,
and be obedient to their mother, and love one another, and all honest Friends,
and delight to go to meetings.
One of his children being of age to remember what he said, he said to her,
'`Tell your two young sisters when they are grown up,
that it is my charge to them so to do, for they may not remember what I say to them now,
and the Lord will be a father to you and a husband to your mother.`'
Seeing one of them crying, he said, '`Be good children, love the Lord,
and obey your mother, and though I am taken away,
you will have your mother left with you, and she will take care of you.`'

Soon after he drew nigh his end, being in a sweet frame of mind,
resigned up to the Lord`'s will, often speaking of his mercies to him.
He said,
'`The Lord has fully satisfied my desires;`' and took
a solemn farewell of his wife and children.
A friend being present, prayed to the Lord to be near him in that present exercise,
and make his passage easy; after which he took the said friend by the hand,
and expressed his great peace and satisfaction, and passed away,
being sensible to the last.
He died the 28th of the Eighth month, 1675.

DEBORAH SANDHAM, wife of Robert Sandham aforesaid, was born near Youghall, in Ireland;
she received truth soon after her husband, and was a faithful,
serviceable woman to her end, bearing a true and sound testimony for God and his truth,
and was very exemplary in conduct.
She survived her husband about twenty years, taking due care of her children,
which fulfilled their father`'s dying words to them.
When it pleased the Lord to visit her with the sickness whereof she died,
she perceiving one of the family to be much concerned at it, said, '`Be not concerned,
I am freely given up to the will of the Lord, either to live or to die.
If the Lord have any further service for me, he can lengthen my days, if not,
I am freely resigned to his will.`'
She was often in her sickness inward with the Lord,
being kept in great patience and quietness, exhorting Friends,
and inviting some of her relations and neighbors who came to visit her,
to receive the truth; also warning some unfaithful ones,
not to let slip the day of their visitation.
She also exhorted her children to mind her frequent advice and counsel to them,
and to fear the Lord, and to keep out of all that which grieves his righteous spirit;
'`as (said she) your dear and tender father on his deathbed exhorted you, even so do.
Love the truth, and love one another, and then the Lord will be a father to you,
as truly he has been a husband to me.
My desires have been, and are still, that you may fear and love the Lord,
and reverence him, for your mother does not die without a hope,
that the Lord who has begun his good work in you, will carry it on,
and that the blessing of the Lord will rest upon you,
which is more than all visible things; as my soul has been a witness of,
as my mind has been kept from coveting after them, having seen,
that godliness is great gain, and in the gain of it is great peace.`'

One of her daughters not being with her in the time of her sickness,
she desired to be helped up, that she might write a few lines with her own hand,
as her last words to her, which were as follow: '`I not knowing as yet,
whether it be the will of my heavenly Father to finish my days, I am,
through the great mercy of God, freely given up.
Oh! this I have in my heart to say to you, be faithful, be faithful,
and dwell in holy patience; and the same is to your husband.
Oh! that you may come to holy silence with fear and dread,
then will the work of the Lord prosper, which is more than all works.
You have many of my exhortations, which get together, and keep and mind,
and the God of peace support you; you not being in a condition to come to me,
so farewell in the Lord.`'

The day before her departure, she was fervent in prayer to the Lord,
that he would bless his people, and enable them to walk faithfully before him,
and that his truth might prosper,
and that he would please to raise more faithful laborers
for the gathering many more unto righteousness;
also that he would be pleased to bless her children, and their offspring,
and make them his; with much more which cannot be remembered.
The day she died, she said to one of her daughters, '`You are my first-born,
and always very dear to me.
I cannot now say much more to you, but mind my former exhortations,
and remember that truth was more than all, and truth was over all with me,
and truth was your mother`'s chiefest treasure;`' often saying, '`My dear child give me up,
give me up; entreat the Lord to enable you to give me up,
for I am freely given up to the Lord`'s will.`'
Taking her last farewell of her children and grandchildren, with friends and the family,
she desired to have her dear love remembered to Friends at Cork, and elsewhere;
'`my love also (said she) extends farther, to all Friends in England.`'
Some time after, turning herself about in her bed, she said,
'`I am now a going to leave you.`'
And so she quietly, and in great peace,
departed this life the 15th day of the Fifth month, 1695, in Youghall, where she dwelt.

He bore a public testimony for truth, and continued faithful to his death;
and on his dying bed gave very living testimonies to the truth,

for which she suffered many and great abuses from the rude people.
She continued a sincere-hearted Friend to the end of her days,

and continued faithful to his death.
On his dying bed he said that the Lord had done well for him,

ISAAC ALEXANDER, son of Thomas and Alice Alexander, of Bendrig, in Killington,
in the county of Westmoreland, was born in the year 1680,
and convinced of the blessed truth in the year 1694, in the fourteenth year of his age.
In his seventeenth year he received a gift of the ministry,
and became an able minister of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

In 1698 he travelled abroad in the work of the gospel, and went into Yorkshire,
and through the east parts of England, till he came to London;
and after his return home he travelled in the same service into Scotland,
and visited all the meetings of Friends in that nation.
After his return from there, he went into the southern and western parts of England;
and three years after, he visited all the meetings of Friends in Ireland,
and most of the meetings in England and Wales.

In the Eighth month, 1705, he began to be much out of health,
and yet attended Friends`' meetings till the middle of the
Tenth month following. On the 21st of the same,
several friends sitting by him, he, being sensible of God`'s salvation,
said in admiration thereof to the Lord, '`To you, to you, be salvation and praise!
This is a day of great salvation.`'
He signified what great mercy it was that the Lord should visit us in our young years,
and reveal his blessed truth to us,
and how unworthy many were before the Lord did make bare the arm of his salvation;
further saying, '`How near has the Lord been to me in the time of my sickness!
Although I have formerly felt much of his power and presence,
yet never enjoyed such plenty thereof,
as since I have been visited with this sickness;`' instancing one night,
wherein he could not sleep,
he enjoyed more abundantly of the love of God than at any other time before.
He said, '`Oh! what an excellent thing it is to keep in the truth,
and visit one another in the life of it.`'
He made a great difference between those who visit
the sick in the sense of the divine life,
and other visitors, who no sooner meet but they begin to talk of their worldly affairs.
He said, '`Friends, get into an inward acquaintance with the Lord in spirit,
for it is a good thing to retire to the rock; there is safety, there is good standing,
an excellent bottom, and room enough.`'
He further said, '`If any go out of the bounds of truth,
thinking thereby to bring others in,
they will find themselves to be in slippery places;`' and '`Beware of joining with false,
unsettled spirits.`'
Another time, two friends sitting by him, he felt the power and presence of the Lord,
and sang praises to him after a heavenly manner, saying, '`My heart is full,
though I can truly say, I have no desire to speak,
but as I feel it spring from the life.`'

On the 28th of the Tenth month he said, '`As I lay on my bed very weak of body,
I thought I could never die better, for I felt my salvation sealed unto me.
Oh! love God, love God, for he is worthy.
You may love any thing else too much, but you can never love God too much.
Oh! what has he done for my soul; he has given me everlasting comfort; it is enough;
it is enough, indeed.`'
He said, moreover, '`There are two things which are to my great satisfaction:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
_1st._ That ever since the Lord manifested himself to me,
I have freely given up myself to his requirings, and delivered his word faithfully,
and have not sought to please men, neither did I look for great things.
What I desired was, that I might have a place among the sanctified.`'

[.numbered]
_2ndly._
I have always been against libertine spirits, and have had no familiarity with them;
these things are now my comfort.`'

====

He also said, '`Oh!
I have seen glorious things, yes, such things as I never saw before.
I beheld a friend lately deceased in a glorious place, and that I was to be with him;
and I said it is enough to be there.
Oh! such salvation!`' Again, '`I am glad I can say, O death, where is your sting;
and grave, where is your victory?`'
Another time, some friends visiting him,
he related to them how the Lord had raised him from nothing to bear a testimony for him,
and wheresoever the Lord drew me I have followed him,
both in this nation and other nations, and sought not favor and interest among men.
He warned and cautioned the negligent to be diligent and faithful,
and come up in the service of truth; and said,
The Lord will cause a dreadful day to overtake the disobedient and the negligent;`' saying,
'`It is sealed to my soul, that it hastens on quickly.`'

He often said at times, in great weakness of body,
'`I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, but the Lord`'s will be done;`' adding,
'`The Lord`'s presence is here;`' giving thanks for his divine help, saying,
'`I never lacked comfort from him in this time of sickness.
Friends, it is an excellent thing to have a conscience void of offense towards God.
Keep your hearts clean.
I have discharged my duty to all people,
so that I find nothing but that I am fully clear; I am fully clear.`'
After a little time he broke forth in a sweet harmony,
and lifted up his voice in prayer to the Lord, which had been very low several weeks,
saying, '`Lord God! though my exercises and pain of body abound,
your power and life do much more abound,
and carry me over all;`' fervently begging of the Lord to
be with all his faithful laborers all the world over,
rendering thanks for his glorious appearance, saying, '`Worthy, worthy, are you, O Lord,
of all honor, thanksgiving and praise.`'
He prayed for an easy passage out of this world, which the Lord granted him;
for about the second hour the same day, in the afternoon, he fell asleep,
and twelve hours after, he said to a friend present, '`Lay my head better;`' which done,
he said, '`Now I will fall upon my sleep,`'
and immediately went away as if he had fallen into a natural sleep.

He died the 12th of the Twelfth month, 1705, at the house of James Wilson, at Aba,
near Kendal; and the 15th of the same month was buried at Brigflats, near Sedbergh.

ANNE CAMM, late wife of Thomas Camm, of Camm`'s-Gill, was daughter of Richard Newby,
in the parish of Kendal, in Westmoreland, a family of good repute,
being always religiously inclined.
Her father was convinced of the blessed truth in 1652, and died therein a faithful man.
Anne Camm was born in the Eighth month, 1627;
and was well educated in learning proper for her sex.
About the thirteenth year of her age,
she was sent up by her parents to an aunt at London,
where she became acquainted with a religious people called Puritans.
Her stay in London was about seven years, from which she returned to Kendal.
After some time there, she removed to the city of York,
and dwelt in a family of great account in the world, her mistress being a pious woman,
after whose decease she returned again to Kendal,
her society still being with the most religious where she came.

At Kendal there was a seeking people, who met often together,
sometimes sitting in silence, other times in religious conferences,
and often in fervent prayer.
John Audland living remote, yet sometimes fell in among them; and about the year 1650,
John Audland and she married,
and they were both convinced of truth in the beginning of 1652,
by the ministry of that honorable servant of Christ, George Fox.
So powerfully did God, by his sanctifying word and spirit, work upon them,
that they were thereby made effectual instruments in his hand,
to preach the gospel unto others in the next year, 1653, and so forward,
until the Lord put a period to their days.

The first place the said Anne Audland was called of the Lord to visit, except about home,
was the county of Durham, about the beginning of the year 1654,
and she preached truth to the people in the town of Aukland, in the said county,
on a market day, for which she was imprisoned in the town jail,
where she spoke to the people through the window,
and several were affected with her testimony; and towards evening she was discharged.
John Langstaff, who was of great repute among his neighbors, owned her testimony,
and went with her into prison, and when released brought her to his house;
but John`'s wife being no Friend, chid with her husband,
which made Anne very uneasy to stay there.
So she walked out in the fields to seek some covert place to take up her lodging in;
but Anthony Pearson, of Rampshaw, a late justice of the peace,
who lived some miles distant, having knowledge by George Fox, who was at his house,
of Anne`'s coming to that town, came with a horse and pillion,
and took her home to his house that night.

After her service in those parts was over, she returned home;
and in the winter following, she, with Mabel Camm, wife of John Camm,
travelled through Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, into Oxfordshire,
to the town of Banbury, where Mabel Camm had a concern to go to the steeple-house;
and spoke to the priest and people, and Anne accompanied her.
Whereupon the people rudely hurried them out of the house, and abused them in the yard.
The priest passing by, Anne Audland said, '`Man, behold the fruits of your ministry.`'
Next day they were sent for before the mayor,
who had got two witnesses to swear Anne had spoken blasphemy,
for which they committed her to prison.
Mabel Camm was dismissed, and travelled to Bristol, where she met with her husband,
John Camm.
After some days, two men in Banbury gave bond for her appearance at the next assize,
by which she was a kind of prisoner at large,
which gave opportunity for her to have several meetings with the people in the town.
Her two bonds-men, and several hundreds more, came to be convinced of truth,
and turned to the Lord Jesus Christ,
being the fruits of that effectual powerful ministry God had called her to bear,
so that many were added to the church,
and a large meeting of Friends there was in that town,
and several other meetings in the country adjacent were settled.
For this cause their adversaries were angry,
and they threatened that she should be burned when the assize came.

When the assize came, John Audland, John Camm, and Thomas Camm were there,
and some Friends from London and Bristol;
and the substance of the charge or indictment drawn up against her was,
that she had said God did not live,
because she had said concerning the priest at Banbury,
that '`True words may be a lie in the mouth of some that speak them;`' alleging,
Jer. 5:2, "`And though they say the Lord lives,
(which nothing can be more true,) surely they swear falsely.`"
The judge of the court was moderate,
observing her sober and wise answers to his questions, and her innocent boldness,
and comely personage, and seeing the uncertainty of the evidence against her,
and that the matter of fact charged, did not amount to what was designed,
gave the matter to the jury thus:
'`That she acknowledged the Lord her God and Redeemer to live,
and that there were gods of the heathen and of the Philistines that were dead gods.`'
Some upon the bench perceiving their end would not be answered,
went off to influence the jury to bring in something against the prisoner,
lest they should come off with discredit.
One of the bench observing the injustice in that matter, stepped off also, telling them,
he would sit no longer with them, till more justice was among them,
and was convinced of truth.
Other officers in the court threw away their staves,
and bore testimony against their arbitrary proceedings.

The jury returning into court, and being asked if they were agreed,
they answered they were; and being asked what they found, they made answer,
'`Only misdemeanor.`'
A friend present told them it was illegal to indict
her for one fact and bring her in guilty of another;
for they ought to have found her either guilty or not guilty,
upon the matter of fact charged in the indictment.
The judge told Anne, if she would give bond for her good behavior,
she might have her liberty.
She refusing, they sent her to prison again: but the judge was heard to say,
that the prisoner should have been discharged,
but the judge had a mind somewhat to please the angry justices.
Her adversaries were confounded, and slipped off the bench one after another,
in disorder, without dismissing the court, so that truth was that day exalted,
and the Lord`'s power magnified in frustrating the designs of wicked men.
The prison where Anne was sent to, was a close nasty place, several steps below ground,
on the side whereof was a sort of common sewer,
that received much of the mud in the town, that at times did stink sorely;
besides frogs and toads did crawl into the room, and no place for fire,
yet she was in great content because it was God`'s cause.
Her fellow-prisoner was Jane Waugh, a laborer in the gospel,
who came some months before to visit her, and was committed to prison with her;
but God`'s presence and peace being with them, made their nasty stinking jail a palace,
where she remained seven or eight months, and from her first commitment,
about a year and a half, and was at last discharged by the mayor and aldermen.
The same day Richard Farnsworth was set at liberty, who,
with other men Friends were prisoners in another room;
but Jane Waugh still continued a prisoner.

Anne had frequent meetings in Banbury before she left it;
and also went to the mayor to demand the liberty of her friend Jane Waugh,
who was imprisoned for no other fact,
than for coming many miles in love to visit her in prison,
and she was soon after set at liberty.
Being clear of those parts, she travelled through the counties to Bristol,
where she met with her husband John Audland.
John and Anne Audland continued in their service and labor
in the ministry in several parts of this nation,
south, west, and northward, until John Audland fell sick,
and died in the latter end of the year 1663,
having been married to his wife Anne about thirteen years, and left behind one daughter,
since dead, and one son named John, born a few days after his father`'s death.

The 30th of the Third month, 1666, Thomas Camm married the said Anne Audland,
and they lived together in true love, serving the Lord six months short of forty years.
She was one with her husband in all his services and sufferings,
as at one imprisonment three years at Kendal,
he not being permitted so much as to see his family; another time at Appleby,
near six years, during the first part of which he was straitly confined, the latter,
through favor of the sheriff and jailor, he had much liberty.
They travelled together in the work of the ministry into the southern parts of the nation,
as London and Bristol, etc., especially at London.
About twenty-six years ago, she had like to have died in that city,
as also of later years at Bristol.
The last time she was there, she was brought nigh the grave;
at which time she expressed many heavenly sayings,
that will not be easily forgotten by some, warning all to prize their time,
and prepare for their latter end, as God had inclined her to do,
so that she enjoyed unspeakable peace here,
with full assurance of eternal rest and felicity in the world to come, which, said she,
I have desired to enter into as gain, rather than to live, if God so please.

It was her manner often to retire alone in her closet, or some private place,
exercising herself in fervent prayer,
and to set apart some time almost daily for reading the holy Scriptures,
and other good books,
and she was very diligent in frequenting meetings for the worship of God, etc.
She was not forward to appear in preaching or prayer in public meetings,
but when she did, it was fervent, weighty, and with the demonstration of the spirit,
and with power, to the refreshment of the church, her doctrine dropping as dew,
but with zeal to lay waste the mountain of Esau.
She had wisdom to know the time and season of her service,
in which she was a good example to her sex,
for without extraordinary impulse and concern,
it was rare for her to preach in large meetings,
where she knew there were brethren qualified for the service of such meetings.
She was grieved when any, especially of her sex, were too hasty, forward,
or unseasonable in their appearing in such meetings; and would give advice to such,
not without good effect.
She behaved herself as a humble servant of her Lord and Master, Christ Jesus,
washing his disciples`' feet, and helping and serving, as a nursing-mother,
the weakest and tenderest of the flock of Christ,
and was an encourager of those who came forth in a testimony for God,
though but of a stammering tongue.

The last opportunity she had among friends was the 2nd of the Ninth month, 1705,
at a monthly-meeting at Kendal; and notwithstanding her great age and weakness of body,
with the coldness of the season, she would not excuse herself from that day`'s service;
and the Lord was with her in good counsel and advice to friends,
pressing all to faithfulness and diligence in their service for God,
that they might receive their reward with those who had nearly served out their day.
The next day her illness began.
About the 16th of the said month, finding her husband under concern,
because of her sickness, she said as follows:

'`My dear, if it be the Lord`'s good pleasure, who joined us together,
and has blessed us hitherto, to separate us outwardly,
I entreat you be content therewith, and give me freely up to the Lord,
for you know we must part,
and if I go first it is but what I have desired of the Lord many a time.
I believe the consideration of the desolate condition I should be in, if left behind you,
will have that place with you, that you will the more freely commit me to the Lord,
whose I am, and whom I loved, feared and served with an upright heart all my days.
His unspeakable peace I enjoy, and his saving health is my portion forever.
I pray you be content with what the Lord pleases to do with me; whether life or death,
his holy will be done.
Let us, my dear, leave all to the Lord.
However it be, it will be well.
I have loved you with my soul, and God has blessed us, and will bless you,
and be with you, and make up all your losses.
Death is gain to me, though it be your loss, and for my gain`'s sake,
I hope you will bear with patience your loss.
I bless the Lord I am prepared for my change.
I am full of assurance of eternal salvation, and a crown of glory,
through my dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom God the Father has sent to bless me,
with many more, by turning us from the evil of our ways into the just man`'s path,
which shines more and more to the perfect day.
If God now please to finish my course, and take me out of this earthly tabernacle,
I am well content.
I am clear, and have discharged myself in the sight of God to all Friends,
except something of late has been upon my mind,
to send Friends in the south a farewell epistle,
especially to Friends about Bristol and Banbury.
She said the substance thereof was the remembrance
of her dear love to them all in the truth,
with tender advice to the professors of truth, to walk in, and keep to,
the simplicity thereof, out of heights and exaltedness,
under the power of the cross of Christ,
by which they will be more and more crucified to the world, and baptized into Christ,
and put him on, the new and heavenly man, in whom they will become new creatures,
and enabled to serve God in spirit,
and keep to the unity thereof in the bond of peace and love,
which the god of the world is still laboring to break and dissolve.
I have seen him at work to make a breach and separation among Friends,
and if he prevail,
it will be under specious pretenses of a more angelical
appearance than at any time before,
and will be a bait taking to all that live above the cross and true self-denial.
I would all were warned to stand their ground in the power of God,
which only can bruise Satan, and preserve out of his subtle baits and snares.`'

Next day several Friends came to see her, to whom she gave good advice and counsel,
'`To prize their time: and oh!
I bless my God,`' said she, '`that I lie now in great peace, and content of mind and soul,
though my body be held with pain.
Oh! that it may be so with you all, my dear friends.`'

When she was very weak, some Friends would ask her if she knew them; '`Yes,`' said she,
'`I know you every one.
I have my understanding as clear as ever, for how should it be otherwise,
since my peace is made with God through the Lord Jesus Christ.
I have no disturbance in mind,
therefore is my understanding and judgment so good and clear,
for it were sad to lie under affliction of body and mind, to feel pinching pangs of body,
even to death, and to lack peace with God.
Oh! that would be intolerable to bear.
Oh! let my soul praise the Lord for his peace and plenteous redemption.`'

Her son-in-law, John Moore, having skill in medicine, administered somewhat to her,
after which they thought she was better, and he was gone towards Swarthmore.
She soon grew worse again; upon which her husband would have sent for him back,
and also for her daughter, but she was unwilling, saying, '`Be not careful in the matter;
the Lord my God is near me, and I have your company, and it is enough,
and all will be well.
If this lump of clay, in which I dwell, be dissolved,
I have full assurance of an house and dwelling, God is the maker of,
that will never wax old, nor be dissolved.
Oh! my soul, bless you the Lord, and be glad in his salvation forevermore.`'

Her illness increased upon her, and many friends came to visit her, to whom she said,
'`Oh! the cross is the only way to the crown immortal.
Shun it not, therefore, lest you fall short of the crown;
and stand up nobly for your testimony to the truth in all things,
and particularly against the popish anti-christian yoke of tithes,
for which many have not only suffered great spoil of goods, but imprisonment till death,
and have received a crown of life.
Oh! if all that have been called to this testimony, had stood firm and true therein,
God would have wrought wonders more abundantly, but unbelief makes a long wilderness;
it is well if some die not in it, and never see the promised land.`'

About two days before she died, she gave good advice to her grandchildren and servants,
and said to her husband, '`My dear,
you have spent much time and strength in serving truth and Friends;
your reward with God is sure.
I never grudged your absence in that good service; and if it be the time of our parting,
as I think now it will, I pray you quit yourself of the things of this world,
as much as may be,
that you may with the more freedom pursue that honorable
service for truth to the end of your days.
I hope the Lord will give you strength to travel into the southern parts again,
and remember my love to all friends, and warn all, but especially the rich, to keep low,
and not be high-minded, for humility and holiness are the badge of our profession.
God Almighty keep us all low and humble; it is a safe and blessed state.
And, my dear, one thing I beg of you; give me up freely to the Lord.
The Lord joined us, and gave us to each other; let us bless his name,
if he now take us from each other in the outward, that is all;
for our joining in spirit stands and remains forever.
Oh! therefore let me go easy out of this world,
where I have had a great share of trouble many ways you know,
and get to that haven of rest, that I have the full assurance of sealed upon my spirit.`'

A little before she died, some fainting fits taking her, she revived again, and said,
'`I was glad, thinking I was going to my eternal rest without disturbance.`'
Again she said,
'`I have both a sight and sense of eternal rest with God in the world to come;
and therefore I labor hard to be swallowed up in immortal life,
and to be made possessor of that rest that cannot be disturbed, where sorrow will cease,
and be no more forever.
Oh! my soul, this is your glorious portion; therefore bless you the Lord,
and wait patiently his good and appointed season.`'
Then she desired to be helped up in her bed; but her pains increased:
she grew very weak and faint, and said, '`I think I grow weak and cold.
My hands and feet are grown very cold, yet my heart is very strong before it yields.
I must meet with sharper pangs than I have yet felt.
My God has hitherto laid a gentle hand upon me.`'
She desired to lie down again, but could not stay, but being set up in bed again,
she said, '`This pain is hard to flesh and blood, but must be endured a little time;
ease and eternal rest is at hand.
I am glad I see death so near me.
Oh! remember me to all my dear babes and grandchildren.
I shall with these eyes behold them no more.
God Almighty bless them all, and make them all his children,
that I may enjoy them forever in the heavens above.
Neither shall I see my sons and daughter.
Ah! my prodigal son, what shall I do for him?
I have prayed and longed for his return.
The time may come, God grant it may, but I shall not see it in my time.
He is my son, the son of a godly father, and therefore I cannot but love him.
Tell him it is his immortal soul`'s well-being that I am concerned for;
not so much his outward state here, for that, though never so miserable,
will quickly end, but the misery of the soul separated from God will never end.
And, my dear, though our counsel has not had the desired end, yet I do entreat you,
remain a father to him in repeated counsel.
Leave him not to run on in the way of misery, but labor and pray for his return.
Oh! you have been true to me in bearing with me many a heavy burden,
and have done abundance for him every way, for my sake;`' with more to that purpose.
My love to his wife; I desire she may mind heavenly things,
and pray God bless their offspring, that they may walk in the steps of their grandfather,
who is gone to his eternal rest;`' with well-wishes for her son and daughter Moore,
and blessings upon their children.

The day she died, many friends came to see her, being their monthly meeting-day,
to whom she gave good advice, and expressed her joy and comfort in the salvation of God,
peace and perfect redemption.
Seeing friends weep, she said, '`Be not concerned, for all is well;
I have only death to encounter, and the sting of it is wholly taken away;
the grave has no victory, and my soul is ascending above all sorrow and pain.
So let me go freely to my heavenly mansion, disturb me not in my passage.
My friends, go to the meeting, let me not hinder the Lord`'s business,
but let it be chief, and by you all done faithfully,
that at the end you may receive your reward, for mine is sure.
I have not been negligent, my day`'s work is done.`'

Friends went to the meeting, and in a little time her pains increased,
which she bore with patience, but sighed deeply,
praying the Lord to help her through her agony of death.
After some words, she said, '`Oh! my God, oh! my God, you have not forsaken me,
blessed be your name forever.
Oh! my blessed Lord and Savior who suffered, for me and all mankind,
great pains in your holy body upon the cross, remember me, your poor hand-maid,
in this my great bodily affliction.
My trust is in you, my hope is only in you, my dear Lord.
Oh! come, come, dear Lord Jesus, come quickly, receive my soul.
To you I yield it up; help me now in my bitter pangs.`'
These indeed were very great, and her husband prayed by her,
that the Lord would make her passage easy; and she had no more such pangs,
but drew her breath shorter by degrees, and said very little more,
but that it was good to leave all to the Lord; saying, '`Oh! pray, pray, pray,`'
and so fell asleep in the Lord, in a good old age, being in her seventy-ninth year,
as a shock of corn in season.
She died the 30th of the Ninth month, 1705, and was honorably buried:
many ancient Friends of about thirteen adjacent meetings accompanied her to the grave,
the 3rd of the Tenth month, 1705.

END OF THE THIRD PART.
