[short="On Virtue"]
== Chapter 12. On Virtue

It is in this way that we acquire virtue with facility and certainty.
For as God is the fountain and origin of all virtue,
it is in proportion as we approach and lay ahold of _Him_,
that we likewise grow up into the most eminent virtues.
Indeed, he that has God, has all things; and he that has Him not, has nothing.
All virtue is but as a mask, an outside appearance, changeable as our garments,
when it does not spring up from this one Divine source.
But when it does, it is indeed genuine, essential, and permanent, for David has said,
"`The King`'s daughter is all glorious within.`"^
