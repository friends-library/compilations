[short="God Dwells in the Heart"]
== Chapter 1. The Spirit of God Dwells in the Heart of Man

It is certain from Scripture that the Spirit of God dwells within us,
that a "`manifestation of this Spirit is given to us to profit withal,`"^
footnote:[1 Corinthians 12:7]
and that this is "`the true Light,
which enlightens every man that comes into the world.`"^
footnote:[John 1:9]
"`This is the grace of God which brings Salvation, and which has appeared unto all men;
teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly, in this present world.`"^
footnote:[Titus 2:12]
But we make too little account of this internal Teacher,
which is like the soul of our soul,
and by which alone we are able to form any good thoughts and desires.

God does not cease to reprove us for evil,
and to influence us towards that which is good; but the noise of the world without,
and of our own passions within, deafen us, and hinder us from hearing Him.

We must therefore retire from all outward objects,
and silence all the desires and wandering imaginations of the mind,
that in this profound silence of the whole soul,
we may hearken to the ineffable voice of the Divine Teacher.
We must listen with an attentive ear, for His is a still, small voice.
Indeed, it is not a voice uttered in words as when a man speaks to his friend;
but it is an inward perception infused by the secret
operations and influences of the Divine Spirit,
drawing and empowering us to obedience, patience, meekness, humility,
and all the other Christian virtues,
in a language perfectly intelligible to the attentive soul.
But how seldom it is that the soul keeps itself silent enough for God to speak!
The murmurings of our vain desires and self-love
disturb all the teachings of the Divine Spirit.
Should we then be surprised that so many persons--apparently devout,
but too full of their own wisdom,
and confidence in their own virtues--are not able to hear it;
and that they look upon this internal Word as the delusion of fanatics?
Alas, what is it they aim at with their vain reasoning?
The external word, even of the Gospel,
would be but an empty sound to man without this living and fruitful
Word in the interior to interpret and open it to the understanding.

Jesus Christ says: "`Behold, I stand at the door, and knock--if any man hears My voice,
and opens the door, I will come unto him, and sup with him, and he with Me.`"^
footnote:[Revelation 3:20]
His knocks are the warnings and instructions of His Spirit,
which touch us and operate within us.
And to attend to these warnings and follow them is what it means to open unto Him.

God also speaks in impenitent sinners; but these,
engrossed in the eager pursuit of worldly pleasures,
and the gratification of their evil passions, are not able to hear Him.
His Word with them is overlooked as a fable.
But woe unto those who receive their consolation in this life.
The time will come when their vain joys shall be confounded.

He speaks in sinners who are in the path of conversion.
These feel remorse in their conscience,
and this remorse is the voice of God which reproves them inwardly for their vices.
When they are truly touched, they have no difficulty in comprehending this secret voice,
for it is this that so pierces them to the heart.
It is that two-edged sword within them of which St. Paul speaks,
which cuts even to the dividing of the soul from itself:
"`The Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword;
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow;
and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.`"^
footnote:[Hebrews 4:12]

He speaks in persons who are enlightened and learned,
and whose outward life seems adorned with many virtues;
but often these persons--being full of themselves and their own knowledge--give
too much ear to themselves to be able to listen to God.
God, who desires only to communicate Himself,
finds no place (so to speak) to introduce Himself into souls that are so full of themselves,
and so overfed with their own wisdom and virtues.
He hides His secrets from the wise and prudent, and reveals them to the low and simple.
Our blessed Redeemer said: "`I thank You, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent,
and have revealed them unto babes.`"^
footnote:[Matthew 11:25]
It is with the humble and childlike that He delights to dwell,
and to these He discloses His ineffable secrets.
Indeed it is these who are more peculiarly qualified to receive, in a greater measure,
the gift of faith; for,
being willing that the pride of human reason should be laid in the dust,
they do not obstruct the entrance of this gift by their vain arguments;
but rather believe with simplicity and confidence.
