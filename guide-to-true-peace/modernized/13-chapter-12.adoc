[short="On Virtue"]
== Chapter 12. On Virtue

It is thus that we acquire virtue with facility and certainty;
for as God is the fountain and principle of all virtue,
in proportion as we approach to the possession of Him,
in like proportion do we rise into the most eminent virtues.
Indeed, he that has God, has all things; and he that has Him not, has nothing.
All virtue is but as a mask, an outside appearance, mutable as our garments,
if it does not spring up from this Divine source; and then, indeed, it is genuine,
essential, and permanent: "`The King`'s daughter,`" says David,
"`is all glorious within.`"^
