=== A Short Account of William Leddra, Who Suffered Martyrdom

[.signed-section-context-open]
The 14th of First Month, 1661.

William Leddra, an inhabitant of the Island of Barbados,
being convinced of the principles of Truth as held by the religious Society of Friends,
and believing himself divinely called to travel in New England,
came to Newbury in the year 1658, where he was taken up,
and with his companion William Brend, carried to Salem in Massachusetts.
The magistrates of this place asked them if they were Quakers;
and being told they were so called in scorn,
they charged them with denying that Christ who died at Jerusalem,
and also the Holy Scriptures.
These false accusations they boldly contradicted,
declaring they owned no other Lord Jesus Christ but he who suffered at Jerusalem,
and that they owned the Holy Scriptures.
They were, however, sent to the House of Correction,
and at length removed to Boston and again imprisoned, with orders that they should work.
Unwilling thus to recognize the power of their persecutors,
they were kept five days without food, and then whipped with a three corded lash.

After the infliction of this unmerited punishment,
William Leddra was banished from Boston on pain of death;
but believing it his duty to return there,
he was apprehended and thrust into an open jail,
where he was kept during an extremely cold winter, chained to a log of wood.
Here his hardships and sufferings were so great,
that it seemed as if his persecutors designed to destroy him;
but he was supported through them all, and on the 9th of first month 1661,
was brought before the Court of Assistants with his chain and log at his feet.
On being told that he had incurred the penalty of death,
he meekly asked what evil he had done?
Being answered, that he owned the Quakers who had been hung,
and refused to put off his hat in court, and said "`thee`" and "`thou;`" he replied,
"`Then you put me to death for speaking English and for not putting off my clothes.`"

Finding that his persecutors were resolved if possible to shed his blood,
he appealed to the laws of England for his trial, saying,
that if found guilty by those laws, he refused not to die.
But the court overruled his appeal,
and endeavoured to persuade him to renounce his religion
and embrace that established by law.
But he felt conscientiously bound to testify against a religion which
would countenance men in cruelly persecuting and putting persons to death,
because they dare not embrace it; and looking upon those who were thus seeking his life,
he boldly exclaimed, "`What! join with such murderers as you are?
Then let every man that meets me, say, '`Lo,
this is the man that has forsaken the God of his salvation.`'`"
Sentence of death was passed upon him,
and the 14th of the same month fixed for its execution.

On the morning when this servant of the Lord Jesus sealed his testimony with his blood,
the governor came to the prison with a military guard; William`'s irons were knocked off,
and taking a solemn leave of his fellow prisoners,
he cheerfully went forth to meet death.
The guard surrounded him, in order to prevent any of his friends from speaking to him;
and when they reached the appointed place,
he took an affectionate leave of his friend Edward Wharton, saying,
"`All that will be Christ`'s disciples must take up his cross.`"
Then taking his stand where the guard directed him, he addressed the people thus;
"`For bearing my testimony to the Lord against the deceivers and deceived,
am I brought here to suffer.`"
When the executioner was putting the halter about his neck, he calmly said,
"`I commend my righteous cause unto you, O God;`" and as he was turned off, he cried out,
"`Lord Jesus receive my spirit.`"

Thus did this innocent martyr lay down his life cheerfully,
and patiently suffer for the name and testimony of his Lord and Saviour.
The frame of his mind, at this solemn period was such as became a true Christian,
and the divine enjoyments of which he was permitted to partake,
seem to have been a larger foretaste of the blessedness of heaven,
than often falls to the lot of men, as will be seen by the subjoined letter,
written the day before his execution.
It is addressed as follows:

==== To the Society of the Little Flock of Christ, Grace and Peace be Multiplied

[.salutation]
Most dear and inwardly beloved,

The sweet influences of the Morning Star, like a flood,
distilling into my innocent habitation,
have so filled me with the joy of the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
that my spirit is as if it did not inhabit a tabernacle of clay,
but is wholly swallowed up in the bosom of eternity, from where it had its being.

Alas, alas, what can the wrath and spirit of man, that lusts to envy,
aggravated by the heat and strength of the king of the locusts,
which came out of the pit, do unto one who is hid in the secret places of the Almighty,
or unto them that are gathered under the healing wings of the Prince of Peace?
Under his armour of light they shall be able to stand in the day of trial,
having on the breastplate of righteousness, and the sword of the spirit,
which is their weapon of war against spiritual wickedness, principalities and powers,
and the rulers of the darkness of this world, both within and without.

Oh, my beloved!
I have waited as a dove at the windows of the ark, and have stood still in that watch,
which the Master, without whom I could do nothing, did, at his coming,
reward with fulness of his love, wherein my heart did rejoice,
that I might in the love and life of God speak a few words to you,
sealed with the spirit of promise,
that the taste thereof might be a savour of life to your life,
and a testimony in you of my innocent death.
And if I had been altogether silent, and the Lord had not opened my mouth unto you,
yet he would have opened your hearts,
and there have sealed my innocency with the streams of life,
by which we are all baptized into that body which is in God,
in whom and in whose presence there is life; in which, as you abide,
you stand upon the pillar and ground of truth: for, the life being the truth and the way,
go not one step without it, lest you should compass a mountain in the wilderness;
for unto everything there is a season.

As the flowing of the ocean does fill every creek and branch thereof,
and then retires again towards its own being and fulness, and leaves a savour behind it,
so does the life and virtue of God flow into every one of your hearts,
whom he has made partakers of his divine nature.
And when it withdraws but a little, it leaves a sweet savour behind it,
so that many can say, they are made clean through the word that he hath spoken to them:
in which innocent condition you may see what you are in the presence of God,
and what you are without him.

Therefore, my dear hearts, let the enjoyment of life alone be your hope,
your joy and consolation;
and let the man of God flee those things that would lead the mind out of the cross,
for then the savour of life will be buried.
And although some may speak of things that they received in the life, as experiences,
yet the life being veiled,
and the savour that is left behind washed away by the fresh floods of temptation,
the condition that they did enjoy in the life, though boasted of by the airy spirit,
will be like the manna that was gathered yesterday, without any good scent or savour.
For, it was well with the man only while he was in the life of innocency;
but being driven from the presence of the Lord into the earth, what can he boast of?

And although you know these things, and many of you, much more than I can say; yet,
for the love and zeal I bear to the truth and honour of God,
and the tender desire of my soul to those that are young,
that they may read me in that from which I write,
to strengthen them against the wiles of the subtle serpent that beguiled Eve; I say,
stand in the watch within, in the fear of the Lord, which is the very entrance of wisdom,
and the state where you are ready to receive the secrets of the Lord:
hunger and thirst patiently, be not weary, neither doubt.
Stand still, and cease from your own working,
and in due time you shall enter into the rest, and your eyes shall behold his salvation,
whose testimonies are sure and righteous altogether.
Let them be as a seal upon your arm, and as jewels about your neck,
that others may see what the Lord has done for your souls.
Confess him before men, yes, before his greatest enemies;
fear not what they can do unto you: greater is he that is in you,
than he that is in the world.
He will clothe you with humility,
and in the power of his meekness you shall reign over all the rage of your enemies,
in the favour of God; wherein, as you stand in faith, you are the salt of the earth; for,
many seeing your good works, may glorify God in the day of their visitation.

Take heed of receiving that which you see not in the light,
lest you give ear to the enemy.
Bring all things to the light, that they may be proved, whether they be wrought in God;
the love of the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eye,
are without the light, in the world;
therefore possess your vessels in all sanctification and honour,
and let your eye look at the mark.
He that has called you is holy: and if there be an eye that offends, pluck it out,
and cast it from you: let not a temptation take hold, for if you do,
it will keep from the favour of God, and that will be a sad state; for,
without grace possessed there is no assurance of salvation: by grace you are saved;
and the witnessing of it is sufficient for you; to which I commend you all,
my dear friends, and in it remain, your brother,

=== Memoir of John Camm

The early history of the religious Society of Friends,
is replete with instances of faithful and devoted servants of Christ Jesus,
who laboured abundantly and with great success in the work of the Gospel,
and after enduring a fight of afflictions,
growing out of the intolerant and persecuting spirit of the age,
finished their course with joy, in the full assurance,
that the religion they had embraced and for which they deeply suffered,
was not a cunningly devised fable but substantial and ever enduring truth.

In this noble list of worthies we find the names of John Camm and John Audland,
two men remarkable for the purity of their lives,
for their fervent piety and devotedness,
and the meekness and patience with which they endured
hardships and imprisonment for righteousness sake.
They were closely united by ties of friendship as well as
the stronger and higher bond of Christian fellowship;
and were companions in travel and in suffering for the cause of their Lord and Master;
and although the period of their ministry was short,
the former dying about four years after his convincement
and the latter in about eleven years,
yet, during that brief space,
they were unwearied in their endeavours to spread the kingdom of the dear Son of God,
and under the leadings of his Spirit, to gather souls unto Him.
Many were the seals of their living and powerful ministry,
in different parts of the nation; men and women who, through their instrumentality,
were gathered to the teachings of Christ Jesus the Shepherd and Bishop of souls;
and diligently hearkening to his voice, were at length enabled to say, "`Now we believe,
not because of your saying,
for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ,
the Saviour of the world.`"

It is at once instructive and cheering to dwell upon the dedicated lives
and peaceful deaths of such humble yet zealous followers of the Lamb;
to ponder their holy and dignified example;
to meditate upon their Christian experience and treasure
up for our own improvement the lessons it teaches;
to mark well how the religion they possessed as well as professed,
bore them up in cheerful resignation amid all the trials
and sufferings which were permitted to assail them,
carried them safely through the vicissitudes and temptations of this troublous life,
and furnished them with a well grounded and solid hope of
a blessed and glorious immortality beyond the grave.
These are fruits which can only be produced by the spiritual,
self-denying religion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;
and where we see them brought forth in such fulness and perfection,
we may rest assured that there this religion exists.

John Camm, the elder of the two Friends of whom we are speaking,
was descended from an ancient and honourable family,
in the barony of Kendal and county of Westmoreland in England.
He was born about the year 1604, at Camm`'s gill,
a place that had been in possession of the family for several generations,
and to which they had given their name.
He received a good education,
and was early blessed with the visitations of the holy Spirit,
by which his heart was contrited and inclined to a life of sobriety and virtue.
As he approached manhood his religious impressions were strengthened,
and an earnest inquiry awakened in his mind after the right way of the Lord.
He saw the lifelessness and formality of the national priests;
and feeling the deadness and dryness of their ministrations, withdrew from their worship;
and being sincere in his inquiry after a religion
which would bring peace and satisfaction to his soul,
he joined company with a select number of persons whose minds were
similarly impressed and in the same seeking tender state.
They were very strict and upright in the performance of their religious duties,
and endeavoured to have their conduct and conversation ordered in the fear of the Lord;
frequently meeting together at Firbank Chapel, and other places,
to seek the Lord and the revelation of the way of life, which their souls thirsted after.

Among these persons were the two Friends above mentioned, Francis Howgill,
Richard Hubberthorn,
and some others who afterward became eminent ministers in the religious Society of Friends.
That some of them were measurably favoured, previous to their convincement,
with divine openings into the spiritual nature of true religion, is apparent;
but not coming fully to the Light of Christ Jesus, inwardly revealed,
and waiting in that to receive power,
they did not obtain the full possession of those things,
of which they were permitted in degree to behold the excellency.

But when it pleased the Lord in his lovingkindness to cause
his Gospel day to spring afresh from on high,
and his light to break forth out of the obscurity with which the unfaithfulness
and apostasy of professing Christendom had clouded it,
and to send his chosen and anointed servants to preach his
glorious Gospel in its own authority and ancient purity,
these seeking souls were as prepared ground, ready, with gladness and meekness,
to receive the Truth in the love of it,
and some hundreds of them were convinced in one day.

The great commotions, both religious and civil,
which had rent England for some years previous;
the sharp and angry controversies on points of doctrine
which were daily carried on between the different professions;
the shifting and changing of opinions to suit the times,
even among those called the dignitaries of the congregations;
had greatly shaken the confidence of the people in their teachers,
while the calamities of war and the hardships and difficulties which many had to endure,
tended to wean them from worldly pursuits and enjoyments,
and turn their attention with increased seriousness,
toward those concerns which related to another and better world.
In the north of England there was a great seeking after religion;
and when that eminent and dignified minister of Christ, George Fox,
travelled through those parts,
his labours in the ministry were crowned with astonishing success.
An early writer among Friends says:

[.embedded-content-document]
--

The Lord called and anointed several for his work, to publish his blessed Gospel day;
to bring glad tidings to the captives and to proclaim the year
of his jubilee--and first and more especially he made choice of
and sent forth his faithful servant and messenger to the nations,
George Fox, into the north country, particularly into Westmoreland, near Kendal,
where the fields were white unto harvest, and a people ripe to be gathered,
who were separated from the world`'s worship, and from many of the dry,
empty forms of religion, and met together by themselves.
They had several among them who were teachers,
the chief of whom were John Audland and Francis Howgill;
+++[+++and John Camm also at times officiated in that capacity.]
Among these the Lord sent George Fox with the message of life, at the publishing whereof,
in the demonstration of the spirit and power of Jesus Christ, the aforesaid persons,
with Edward Burrough and Richard Hubberthorn, and many hundreds more, were convinced,
and their hearts opened by the revelation of the day of God.
In the shining of his heavenly light into their souls,
they came to see that they lacked the lively possession
of that which they had made a great profession of;
and though several of them had esteemed this profession as great riches,
yet now they came to be spoiled of it all; their wisdom being in words only,
was confounded, and they became as fools, and consulted no more therewith,
but bowed at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
All their former knowledge and acquirements now were as dross,
in comparison of the excellency of the knowledge of their Lord, revealed by his spirit,
which they felt at work in them, to regenerate their hearts,
and sprinkle their consciences from dead works and words,
that they might serve the living God.
To this great and necessary work they were strangers,
notwithstanding their high profession.
Then was the day of the Lord terrible upon everything high and exalted,
and many lofty ones, who were even as the tall cedars,
were bowed low under the mighty hand of God.
Judgment began at the house of God, in the heart of man, which is his temple;
and by the spirit of burning he entered there, and carried on his work,
in order to redeem from the bondage of sin, to purge out the leaven thereof,
and make clean vessels, fit for his service,
by whom he might carry on his blessed work among the nations.

--

The narrative given by George Fox of his journey through
the north of England is very remarkable and full of interest,
worthy of a careful perusal,
as exhibiting the convincing power and energy which
at times attends a divinely authorized Gospel ministry,
and the fruits that flow therefrom.
It was on a first-day in the early part of the year 1652, that he came to Firbank Chapel,
in Westmoreland,
where Francis Howgill and John Audland had been preaching
in the morning to an audience so large,
that the meetinghouse would not contain them.
Word was soon spread that George was come,
and the preachers quickly got through their work.
Some of the people went to get dinner,
but many stayed in and near the meeting place without any.
There appears to have been a general opinion that
the preachers and hearers at this place,
were more religious than many others,
for George Fox mentions that some persons came to him,
probably anticipating that he would preach,
and not fully understanding the nature of a true call to the ministry,
and desired he would not reprove them publicly, for they were "`pretty tender men.`"
Francis Howgill had been at a meeting in a steeple-house yard near Sedbergh,
where George preached the day before,
and appears to have been very much convinced by what he heard;
for a certain captain asking George why he would not go into their church,
saying that the yard was not a fit place to preach in;
Francis Howgill stood up and so effectually answered the captain,
that he soon put him to silence; and then remarked, concerning George Fox,
"`This man speaks with authority, and not as the scribes.`"

But whatever might be their conditions,
George Fox knew his calling and the source of his ministry too well,
to attempt to give them any idea beforehand what he should say;
not knowing himself how the Lord would lead him.
His own account is nearly as follows:

[.embedded-content-document]
--

I could not tell them whether I should or no,
though I had not at that time any drawings to declare publicly against them,
but I said they must leave me to the Lord`'s movings.
While others were gone to dinner, I went to a brook,
got a little water and then came and sat down on the top of a rock hard by the chapel.
In the afternoon the people gathered about me, with several of their preachers.
It was judged that there were above a thousand there,
to whom I declared God`'s everlasting truth and word of life, freely and largely,
for about the space of three hours; directing all to the spirit of God in themselves,
that they might be turned from darkness to light and believe in it,
that they might become the children of it,
and might be turned from the power of Satan unto God.
That by the Spirit of Truth they might be led into all truth,
and sensibly understand the words of the prophets, of Christ and of the apostles,
and might all come to know Christ to be their teacher to instruct them,
their counsellor to direct them, their shepherd to feed them,
their bishop to oversee them, and their prophet to open divine mysteries to them;
and might know their bodies to be prepared,
sanctified and made fit temples for God and Christ to dwell in.

In the openings of heavenly life, I explained to them the prophets,
and the figures and shadows, and directed them to Christ the substance.
Then I opened the parables and sayings of Christ, and things that had been long hidden,
showing the intent and scope of the apostles`' writings,
and that their epistles were written to the elect.
When I had opened that state,
I showed also the state of the apostasy since the apostles days;
that the priests have gotten the Scriptures but are
not in the spirit which gave them forth,
but make a trade of the holy mens`' words;
that the teachers and priests now are found in the steps of the false prophets,
chief-priests, scribes and pharisees of old, and are such as the true prophets,
Christ and his apostles cried against,
and so are judged and condemned by the Spirit of Christ,
and none who are in that spirit could own them.

Many old people went into the chapel and looked out at the windows,
thinking it a strange thing to see a man preach on
a hill or mountain and not in the church,
as they called it.
Whereupon I was moved to inform the people,
that the steeple-house and the ground whereon it stood,
were no more holy than that mountain;
and that those temples which they called the dreadful houses of God,
were not set up by the command of God and of Christ;
nor their priests called as Aaron`'s priesthood was,
nor their tithes appointed by God as those among the Jews were; but that Christ was come,
who ended both the temple and its worship, and the priests and their tithes;
and that all now should hearken unto him, for he said,
"`Learn of me;`" and God said of him, "`This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased; hear him.`"
I declared that the Lord God had sent me to preach
the everlasting Gospel and word of life among them,
and to bring them off from all these temples, tithes, priests and rudiments of the world,
which had gotten up since the apostles days,
and had been set up by such as had erred from the
spirit and power that the apostles were in.
Very largely was I opened at this meeting;
the Lord`'s convincing power accompanied my ministry
and reached home to the hearts of the people,
whereby many were convinced, and all the teachers of that congregation, who were many,
were convinced of God`'s everlasting Truth.

--

So fully and effectually did the ministry of George Fox convince those teachers
of the unlawfulness of hireling ministry under the Gospel dispensation,
that they gave back the money they had received for preaching;
and after passing through the necessary baptisms and work of preparation,
became zealous and fervent ministers of the Gospel, in the religious Society of Friends;
labouring abundantly, both at home and abroad,
and scrupulously observing the command of their Lord and Master;
"`Freely you have received, freely give.`"

John Camm was deeply affected at this memorable meeting,
and being given to see that the plain practical religion
to which George Fox bore so powerful a testimony,
was the very thing which his hungry soul had long been seeking in vain,
he was bowed under the mighty power of the Lord,
and induced to give more diligent heed to the manifestations
of the light of Christ in his conscience,
to which George Fox recommended his hearers,
as the certain and safe guide in the way of life and salvation.
As he steadily dwelt under his religious exercises,
patiently enduring the dispensation of condemnation and judgment,
and attending from day to day to the discoveries of the divine Light,
he was strengthened to take up the cross to the friendships and glory of this world,
and to become a fool for Christ`'s sake.
He was accounted a wise man in the world`'s estimation, was in extensive business,
which prospered in his hand, and outward things seemed to smile upon him,
having great reputation where he was known; but in obedience to the heavenly call,
he turned his back upon all these, counting them not worthy to be put in competition,
even for a moment, with that everlasting inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled,
for which he was in good earnest seeking.
He esteemed it a blessed exchange to part with all,
so that he might be made an heir in Christ of the durable
riches and righteousness which can never fade away,
and joyfully became a despised follower of Jesus, through contempt and reproach,
and many tribulations.

He endured a season of close conflict and exercise,
wherein he felt the old heavens and the old earth,
both his former sins and his high profession of religion, to pass away as a scroll;
his acquired wisdom and knowledge were stripped off and cast out,
and he brought back to the state of a little child,
to learn again in the school of Christ, even what he had before gathered in the head,
and to receive his instruction immediately from the living
and inexhaustible Fountain of all true wisdom and knowledge.
All things being thus made new, and all things of God,
as a prepared and sanctified vessel, the Lord filled him with his own power and spirit,
put his living word in his mouth,
and called him away from his temporal concerns and domestic comforts and enjoyments,
which were many,
to go forth and publish among the people the unsearchable riches of Christ.
To this call he yielded a ready and cheerful obedience;
and though he had much to leave behind, and was of a very sickly constitution,
yet he hesitated not, but freely surrendered himself to the divine requiring.

His first journey, which was probably performed early in 1653,
was through the northern counties as far as the borders of Scotland,
and soon after his return from there,
he felt himself religiously engaged to travel southward.
Francis Howgill joining company with him, they proceeded as far as London,
and were among the first called Quakers who published the truth, as held by this people,
in that great city.
A principal object of their visit at this time appears to have been to
deliver a message with which John Camm believed he was divinely commissioned,
to Oliver Cromwell, then protector of the Commonwealth of England.
They not only paid him a visit, but John Camm addressed an epistle to him,
from which the following extracts are taken:

[.embedded-content-document.epistle]
--

On the last day of the first month, called March, +++[+++1654]
about two o`'clock in the morning,
I was moved of the Lord to write these ensuing lines and
to lay before you the cause of our coming to London.
Friend; we came not to petition anything from you in the outward,
but in tender love to exhort you to mind your own condition,
and how you stand in relation to the Lord God of heaven and earth, who is powerful,
and pure and holy; who will not acquit the wicked,
but will wound the hairy scalp of him who goes on in iniquity.

He sees and knows all the secrets of your heart, your outgoings and your incomings,
and to Him you must give an account of all things done in the body,
whether they be good or evil.
Therefore in love to your soul are we moved to exhort
you to stand in the fear of the Lord and in his counsel,
and to mind the divine Light in your conscience, which is pure and of God,
to guide you in the great affairs of the nation.
To keep in his fear is safe,
for dreadful and terrible will the day of the Lord
be to all who are found out of his fear,
acting in their own wills and limiting the Spirit of God,
and walking contrary to his pure law written in the heart by his Spirit.
Knowing the terrors of the Lord, we do exhort you in love to your soul,
for the righteous Seed`'s sake,
which lies in bondage everywhere under the oppressing nature,
that you might be an instrument in the Lord`'s hand,
to take off oppression from the necks of the people and to remove the yoke.
This has long been promised to them, and now the power is in your hand to do it,
and you must give an account to the Lord how you rule for him.

For the mighty day of the Lord is come and coming,
wherein all faces shall gather blackness.
It is a day of darkness, of bitter lamentation and woe,
in which the mountains shall melt and the hills fall before Him;
and all the tall cedars shall bow, and the strong oaks be broken down,
and the rocks rent, yes, the earth shall remove out of its place,
and the Lord will plead with all flesh by his fire and his sword.
Then the lofty shall be brought down and the Lord alone exalted; which day,
we witness fulfilled in measure in us--praises--praises, to the Lord God forevermore.
Having this testimony made manifest in us by the eternal Spirit of God,
we declare this unto you that you may not be found acting against the truth,
for they who are guided by the Spirit of God,
will do nothing against the truth but for the truth.

By this Spirit we are gathered out of the world up
to God and have escaped the pollutions thereof,
and are brought into obedience to the pure law of God written in the heart,
and know his Spirit to be our teacher.
We therefore deny all the teachings of men who have not this Spirit to guide them;
and for so doing we suffer by them.
My sheep know my voice, says Christ, and they follow me,
and the voice of a stranger they will not follow:
we know the voice of Christ and the voice of the stranger;
and by the Spirit of the living God we are gathered together,
to worship him in Spirit and Truth, and are of one heart and one mind,
and have all one teacher and all speak one thing.

--

It appears that during the personal conference with the protector,
Friends had taken occasion to show him how he might be instrumental
in the divine hand in spreading and establishing the Gospel,
from which he had erroneously inferred that they intended he should
exercise his power for that purpose and carry it on by law.
To remove this misapprehension, the epistle proceeds.

[.embedded-content-document.epistle]
--

That was not our desire, nor did we speak any such thing.
We witness that the coming of Christ in his kingdom is not by might or power,
nor with outward pomp or glory; nor by any law which is in the will of man;
and our desires are, that there should be no law upon religion,
for it needs no law to defend it.
Pure religion and undefiled is this, to loose the bonds of wickedness,
to set the oppressed free and take off every yoke; and where pure religion is exercised,
these are the fruits of it;
and if you be guided by the pure light of God shining in your conscience,
and the righteous law of God set up in your heart,
and know the Spirit of God to be your teacher,
then none need desire you to take away these laws which ensnare tender consciences.
And they who pretend conscience, and are not guided by the law of God,
will be seen and known by those who dwell in the Spirit, to have erroneous consciences,
and this divine law will take hold of them:
for the righteous law is upon the transgressor and
limits the carnal mind and fleshly will,
but does not limit the Spirit, but is at unity with it.

Therefore, friend, I speak to your conscience,
and witness this to be true in the presence of God,
that as you are guided by this pure light in your conscience
and the law of the Spirit set up in your heart,
you cannot deny us.
We are none of those who despise government and defile the flesh;
who pull down others to set up themselves;
but we deny all the unfruitful works of darkness and seek
to advance the government of Jesus Christ alone,
and love and have unity with all who are here, honouring all men in the Lord,
and having fellowship with those whose conduct is as becomes the Gospel of Christ.

And where the Spirit of the Lord sets free and commands obedience,
take heed how you allow any law to limit that Spirit;
for they who are brought into the obedience thereof,
are dear unto the Lord as the apple of his eye,
his care is over them and he will free them from their oppressors.`"

--

This epistle concludes with these words:

[.embedded-content-document.epistle]
--

"`Take heed; for he that is in high places is subject to many temptations.`"

--

What effect this simple but earnest address produced on the mind of the protector,
we are not informed, but it appears to have been relieving to the minds of our Friends.
It was not long after his return from this journey,
before John Camm again found his mind drawn to travel in the south of England,
and set out accompanied by four of his neighbours, namely, John Audland, Francis Howgill,
Edward Burrough and Richard Hubberthorn.
They did not however continue long together,
for he and Edward Burrough went through the midland counties to London, where the others,
who had been led by a different route, met them.
In this city there was a great convincement; and a large field was opened before them,
in which they laboured industriously in the cause of their Lord.
After some time John Camm and John Audland believed
themselves called to preach the Gospel in Bristol,
and accordingly went there in the seventh month, 1654.

They were soon joined by Edward Burrough and Francis Howgill;
and the Lord who sent them forth, opened a door of entrance in the hearts of the people,
many of whom gladly received and embraced the truth and continued steadfast therein,
through a long scene of cruel persecution and deep suffering which ensued.
Their preaching, like that of the apostles,
was in demonstration of the Spirit and with power.
Multitudes flocked to hear them, so that the public assemblies,
for lack of room in the usual meetingplaces, were held in the fields,
even in the winter season, increasing to the number of two,
three and sometimes nearly four thousand, of all ages, sexes and professions.
This alarmed the priests, and they stirred up the magistrates,
who on the 30th of October, held a council, at which the mayor presided,
to consult what should be done in the case.

They sent for Edward Burrough and Francis Howgill,
whom they ordered forthwith to leave the city, which they were not free to comply with.
John Camm and John Audland were not molested at that time, but on the 19th of December,
as they were passing over a bridge toward Brislington,
where they had appointed a meeting, they were assaulted by some hundreds of the rabble,
whose blind and ignorant zeal had been aroused by one Farmer,
a persecuting priest of the neighbourhood.
They violently drove back these innocent and unoffending strangers,
beating and kicking them cruelly, and crying out, knock them down--kill them;
hang them presently, and such like expressions.
They attempted to drag them through Wine street out of the city,
in order to accomplish their wicked purpose,
but at length were dissuaded from it by some of the more moderate.
They then dragged them to a building called the Tolzey,
where the merchants met to transact business, and where the courts were held,
and the infuriated mob would probably have torn them in pieces here,
had it not been for the courage and exertions of a friend, who with much personal danger,
pulled them into his house and shut the doors.
The mob, with hideous noises, threatened to pull down the house,
but the Friends quietly awaited the issue, nothing daunted;
their trust and confidence being placed in Him who can deliver in the greatest extremity.
At length the uproar and tumult became so great,
that some officers were dispatched from the garrison to quell it,
and as soon as the mob perceived their approach, they dispersed.

Next day the Friends held their meeting in quietness at Brislington.
Three of the rioters were apprehended and imprisoned, but when their comrades heard it,
they gathered about fifteen hundred persons together and compelled their liberation.
Word being given out that the Quakers were returning into Bristol toward evening,
multitudes assembled on the bridge and on the other side of the river Avon,
belching forth dreadful language and threatenings;
and the magistrates were so fearful lest there should be bloodshed,
that they sent their sword-bearer to acquaint Friends
that they had better not return that way,
as the officers could not protect them.
Thus the Lord preserved them from the wicked fury of their enemies,
who sought to shed innocent blood,
and whose diabolical conduct had filled the city with terror.

The tumult however did not stop here;
the rude multitude saying they should find more protection
from the magistrates than the strangers would,
were encouraged to be yet more violent,
and went so far as to force their way into some of the houses of Friends,
under pretence of preventing treasonable plottings.
When the priests were admonished that these were the fruits of their ministry,
they stirred up the people still more,
and induced the magistrates to imprison some Friends.
This unrighteous act gave fresh courage to the populace,
who now thought they had full license to abuse these unoffending people,
and they began beating, pushing, kicking and treading upon them,
so that blood was frequently shed;
yet all was not sufficient to shake their constancy or induce them to
desert their meetings or to cease to publish the glad-tidings of salvation.

John Camm and John Audland continuing their labours in Bristol,
notwithstanding the heat of the persecution,
the magistrates issued an order dated "`the 22nd of January,
1654,`" directed to all and every of the constables of the city,
requiring them to apprehend those Friends and bring them up for examination.
It so happened however that just before this unjust mandate came out,
these two devoted servants,
feeling themselves released for the present from further service there, had left Bristol;
by which means their persecutors were disappointed of their prey.
Irritated by this circumstance,
and not disposed to allow the Quakers to escape so easily from their grasp,
they put forth another warrant, requiring the officers to search for them.
To show the strange and frivolous pretences under which our primitive Friends were assailed,
we shall give a copy of this warrant.

It is as follows;

[.embedded-content-document.legal]
--

[.signed-section-context-open]
City of Bristol:--

[.salutation]
To all the constables of the peace of the ward of +++_______+++ and to every of them.

Forasmuch as information has been given us upon oath,
that certain persons of the Franciscan order in Rome,
have of late come over into England, and under the notion of Quakers,
drawn together several multitudes of people in London; and whereas certain strangers,
going under the names of John Camm, John Audland, George Fox, James Nayler,
Francis Howgill, and Edward Burrough, and others unknown,
have lately resorted to this city, and in like manner, under the notion of Quakers,
drawn multitudes of the people after them,
and occasioned very great disturbances among us;
and forasmuch as by the said information it appears to us to be very probable,
and much to be suspected,
that the said persons so lately come here are some of those that came from Rome,
as aforesaid; these are therefore in the name of his highness, the lord Protector,
to will and require you to make diligent search through
your ward for the aforesaid strangers,
or any of them,
and all other suspected persons and to apprehend and bring them before us, or some of us,
to be examined and dealt with according to law: hereof fail you not.
Given the 25th of January, 1654.

--

The magistrates affixed their seals to this order, and one of them was so zealous,
that lest there should be any doubt of his signature being to it, he wrote it twice.
It is worthy of remark, that up to the date of this warrant,
George Fox and James Nayler had not been to Bristol,
and as the Society of Friends had greatly increased in England,
and included among its honourable and well known members,
many of the most substantial and reputable people in the kingdom,
the pretence that they were persons of the Franciscan order from Rome,
can only be viewed as arising from a disposition to render the Quakers odious,
in order more effectually to persecute and afflict them.

It does not appear that this attempt to apprehend John Camm and John Audland,
was any more successful than the preceding,
as no account of the arrest or imprisonment of either
of them in consequence of it has come down to us.
It seems probable, that they proceeded pretty directly home after leaving Bristol,
for we find them at Hereford on the 25th of the seventh month, 1654,
and they had left Bristol in the same month.

In 1656, John Camm and John Audland again visited Bristol,
but of their journey or service we have no particulars given.
For a number of years John Camm`'s health had been declining,
and being naturally of a very delicate constitution, and inclined to consumption,
he suffered greatly from debility and a racking cough.
It is indeed surprising, that in his very weak and diseased slate,
he should have been able to leave home at all;
yet such was the fervency and devotion of his spirit,
that he was ready to spend and be spent for the good of his brethren;
and in his zeal for the cause of God his own infirmities seemed to be forgotten.
His son writes thus respecting him:

[.embedded-content-document]
--

For several years before his death he was not able to walk half a mile at one time;
indeed, many times he was not able to go up one pair of stairs, into a meeting place,
without help; yet, nevertheless through the enlivening power and Spirit of God,
he was borne above the sense of his weakness while the meeting continued;
but when it was over was often as one ready to be dissolved.

In this outward weakness he travelled for several years,
through many counties and places in this nation,
confirming and strengthening the flock of God;
sometimes taking me with him to wait upon him,
his weakness becoming so great that he was often
unable to get on or off his horse without help.
Through all this the Lord brought him, his faith being fixed in his power,
and his life and whole delight was in the prosperity of
truth and the increase of righteousness in the earth.

It was his great care in all his travels that the Gospel of Christ which he had to publish,
might be without charge;
all that he possessed or enjoyed of outward things being freely given up to the Lord,
so that he was willing to spend his substance in travelling
and for other purposes to promote the spread of truth.
His heart and house also were open for the entertainment
of Friends who were abroad in the service of the Gospel,
in which he took great comfort and satisfaction.

--

The exertion necessary to make himself heard in those
large assemblies convened in the open air,
produced a very unfavourable effect on his lungs,
and soon after his return from Bristol in 1656, he became unable to leave his house.
The decay of nature,
and the evident approach of dissolution brought no alarm to his peaceful mind.
He knew in whom he had believed,
and that he was able to keep that which he had committed unto him.
Those religious principles which he had embraced himself
and preached to others while in comparative health,
proved sufficient to sustain his spirit during the hours of languor and disease,
with a lively hope that when his change came,
it would be from a world of pain and sorrow to a glorious state,
where all tears and suffering would be forever done away.

The company of faithful friends had been a source
of enjoyment to him ever since he knew the Truth,
and now that he was confined by sickness it seemed more so than ever.
Many came to visit him and he was often remarkably
opened in the visions of life and light,
and greatly overcome with the Lord`'s love and peace,
to which he would bear a fresh and living testimony with divine power and energy,
to the great comfort of his friends and family.
He had a clear sight of some things which afterward came to pass,
and had to declare that a day of spiritual famine was approaching,
in which some who made a great show of religion would
be like the seed sown on stony ground,
or the broken bow in the day of battle.

As a tender and godly father,
he was deeply solicitous for the religious welfare of his beloved family,
and would often call them together,
and exhort them with much fervency to fear the Lord
and walk in holiness of life as became the gospel;
and would often pray for them and bless them in the name of the Lord.

His heart was frequently so filled with heavenly
joy that he would break forth in a wonderful manner,
extolling the great name of the Most High and praising
him for his abundant goodness and mercy.
He esteemed his bodily weakness a blessing,
it being sanctified to him by that eternal Word which had redeemed and sanctified
his soul and made him an honourable vessel in the house of his God;
even a pillar that should go no more out.
On one occasion he said, "`How great a benefit do I enjoy beyond many,
in having such a large time of preparation for death.
I am as it were dying daily,
that I may live forever with my God in that kingdom which is unspeakably full of glory.
My outward man daily wastes and draws towards its place,
but my inward man revives and mounts upwards towards its habitation in the heavens.`"

On the morning of his death he called his wife and
children to him and gave them much excellent counsel;
exhorting them to fear the Lord, love his truth and walk in it with upright hearts;
charging them to be kind and loving to each other.
He then said that his glass was run and the time of his departure at hand,
when he should enter into everlasting joy and rest,
and desired them to be patient and resigned to the Lord`'s will.
Soon after speaking these words he fainted,
and appeared to pass quietly away as one falling into a sweet sleep; at which his family,
who surrounded his bed, were much affected and wept aloud.
This seemed to rouse him again, and desiring to be raised up, he said, "`My dear hearts,
you have wronged and disturbed me, for I was sweetly at rest.
You should not so passionately sorrow for my departure,
for this house of clay must go to its place,
but my soul is to be gathered up to the Lord to live with him forever,
where we shall meet with everlasting joy.`"
He then again bade them all farewell, and lying down on the bed,
quietly departed this life in the eleventh month, 1656.

One of the early Friends, writing respecting him, says,
"`He was a man richly furnished with the gifts of the holy Spirit;
patient in his great exercises and weakness; of a noble spirit,
grave in his carriage and deportment, profound in judgment and of quick discerning;
a sharp reprover of the world and of the wickedness therein,
as also of all deceitful hypocrites and disorderly walkers,
who made a profession of the truth, but walked not according thereto.
The unity of the brethren was his soul`'s joy and delight,
and his sword was keen to wound whatever appeared to break the same.
His ministry was weighty, deep and very powerful;
not pleasant to the itching ears which love smooth words,
but reached the witness for God in the conscience,
and tended to the refreshment of the Seed of the kingdom in the hearts of God`'s people.
To the weary, tossed and afflicted soul, he often had a word of consolation in season,
being very tender over the good in all.`"

Thus having fulfilled his ministry as a good steward of the grace of God,
and adorned the doctrine he preached by a life and conduct answerable thereto,
he finished his earthly course with holy joy, and is entered into that inheritance,
incorruptible, undefiled and that fades not away,
which is reserved in heaven for all the Lord`'s faithful and dedicated servants.

=== Memoir of John Audland

John Audland was born about the year 1630, in the barony of Kendal,
about a mile from Camm`'s gill, the residence of John Camm,
his beloved friend and fellow-labourer in the Gospel.
He was of a good family, and carefully educated,
and when quite a child discovered a quickness and maturity of understanding,
which were much beyond his age.
The natural liveliness of his disposition inclined him to levity and playfulness;
yet he was mercifully preserved from vicious practices.
As he approached the age of seventeen,
the Lord was pleased to visit his soul by the inshinings of his holy light,
under the effects whereof,
he felt himself drawn into greater sobriety and strictness of deportment.
He now became a diligent and attentive reader of the holy Scriptures,
and having a large understanding and retentive memory,
he stored his mind with the knowledge of those sacred writings,
reasoning and drawing his conclusions therefrom,
until he became "`mighty in the scriptures,`" as Apollos of old,
and could speak abundantly respecting religion and its duties.

Being very strict in his religious observances,
according to the degree of light with which he was then favoured,
he acquired considerable reputation among the most serious and strict professors,
with whom he associated, and at times appeared among them in the character of a preacher.

Not satisfied with the national worship,
which he felt to be lacking in life and spirituality,
he went among the most zealous sort of Independents,
teaching and preaching with much earnestness,
the things which he believed to appertain to life and salvation.
Sometimes he went to the chapels and parish places of worship,
where there were idle or dissolute priests, and though a dissenter,
publicly preached to the auditory, which would often be very large;
multitudes flocking to hear him, attracted by his youth,
the fluency of his speech and the energy and sincerity of his manner.
Thus his fame spread abroad,
and he soon came to be esteemed one of the greatest and
most eloquent dissenting preachers in the North of England.
Firbank Chapel, then a meeting place of the Independents,
was generally the scene of his labours,
and his hearers appear to have been strongly attached to him.

The circumstance of John Audland`'s going into the public places of worship,
and there preaching to the people,
before he was convinced of the Christian principles of the religious Society of Friends,
is deserving of notice;
as it shows that the practice was not uncommon among the zealous dissenters,
and that Friends were not singular in it.
It is difficult for us at the present day fully to understand
the peculiar temperament and character of those times,
or to have an adequate idea of the corruption and
lifelessness which had overspread professing Christendom.
It is not at all surprising,
that the great Head of the church should have raised up and sent forth instruments,
to cry, not only against the prevailing vices of the times,
but the specious yet hollow profession of religion
which usurped the place of vital piety,
and by its arrogant pretensions, deceived many an unsuspecting and careless one.
Nor is it to be wondered if these servants of the Lord, viewing this awful delusion,
which many of those called the clergy contributed to spread over the minds of the people,
and the exceeding preciousness of the souls whose salvation was thus jeopardized,
should embrace every opportunity that presented,
to cry against the deceitfulness of a carnal profession,
and call the people away from their idolatrous dependence on human teaching,
to Christ Jesus the shepherd and bishop of their souls; who,
by his Spirit in their hearts,
would teach them savingly those things which belonged to their everlasting peace.
It does not appear that Friends gave any interruption to the usual services,
except on some extraordinary occasions;
generally waiting until the stated speaker had done,
and then in an orderly and becoming manner addressing the assembly,
often after they had retired from the house to the yard.

When about twenty years of age he was married to Ann Newby of Kendal,
a sober and religious-minded woman, who, like himself,
had left the established worship and joined with
the more strict and serious of the Independents.
The Lord was pleased to make them a comfort and blessing to each other,
both of them embracing, about the same time, the religion of the despised Quakers,
as the life and substance of that for which they had long been seeking in vain,
and which they now found to the unspeakable peace and joy of their longing souls.
After his death she became the wife of Thomas Camm, son of John Camm before mentioned.

John Audland was one of the many who were convinced at Firbank Chapel,
of the truth of the religious principles held by Friends, under the simple and unlearned,
but powerfully baptizing ministry of George Fox,
as has already been mentioned in the account of John Camm.
He was then twenty-two years old, and the practical heart searching doctrine he heard,
appears to have struck at the foundation of that lofty superstructure
of professional religion which he had been rearing,
and to have produced a great struggle in his mind.
Standing as he did in the affections and estimation of the people,
it is not surprising that he found it hard work to give
up all his supposed knowledge and experience in religion,
and become in very deed a fool for Christ`'s sake.

The wise and learned of this world,
are apt to sneer at the preaching of those who have never studied in their schools,
and who acknowledge no other call or qualification for the awful work of the ministry
than those which the Lord Jesus is pleased to dispense to such as he ordains therefor;
yet the experience of thousands in the rise of the Society of Friends,
and since that day, can bear testimony to the living virtue,
the awakening and convincing power, as well as the enlivening and consoling effects,
which flow from such a ministry,
even though the instruments appear very weak and contemptible in human estimation;
while the elaborate efforts of the most eloquent and learned speakers,
however attractive as specimens of elegant composition, only serve to gratify the taste,
to delight the imagination or stir up the animal feelings,
leaving little or no durable impression on the mind.
The ear is pleased, but the heart remains untouched,
entrenched as strongly as ever in its own corruptions.

Nor is this at all surprising,
when we remember how little even the very best human means can accomplish;
and that God is jealous of his honour and will not give his glory to another.
Where men are depending on their own powers and acquirements,
and displaying them to an admiring auditory,
the all-powerful and baptizing energy of the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven,
which we are told was the accompaniment of the apostolic ministry,
and a degree of which only can give value and effect to preaching now,
is not likely to be vouchsafed.

From the notable meeting at Firbank Chapel, George Fox went to John Audland`'s house,
who was fully convinced that George was really in the possession
and enjoyment of what he himself knew only in notion,
and being brought, through the clear manifestations of the light of Christ Jesus,
to see the emptiness of his high profession, which had been too much in the head,
while the great work of regeneration in the heart was but little known,
and that all his righteousness was as filthy rags, he sat down silent and astonished,
in great humiliation and abasement of self.
Very deep indeed and weighty was the work of the Lord in his soul,
whereby all his former experience and wisdom were confounded and brought to naught.
His wife thus speaks of it, in her testimony concerning him--

[.embedded-content-document.testimony]
--

Great was the warfare and inward exercise which my dear
husband underwent under the chastising hand of the Lord,
and the spirit of judgment and burning which was at work in him,
in order to sanctify him for the Lord`'s use and service.
For when the Lord`'s blessed day broke upon him, he was high in notion and profession,
imagining himself filled with durable riches and wisdom; but in the light of this day,
he saw the emptiness of it all, while he lacked the substance,
the life of the eternal Word, and to be thereby sanctified throughout.
Under the sense of this lack, many were his sighs and groans, and his tears were not few.
He underwent days and nights of sorrow,
the power of the Lord being as a fire revealed in him,
to burn the great building he had been setting up: and in great lamentation,
I have heard him say, "`Ah! what have we been doing?
What have we been labouring for, and what avails our great profession?
All our building tumbles down--the day of the Lord is upon it,
his Word as a fire consumes it as dry stubble,
and puts an end to all empty professions and high notions, without life or substance,
and to all the wisdom of fallen man.
We must forsake the world and all its glory; it is all but vanity and vexation of spirit.
It is a Saviour I long for--He it is whom my soul pants after.
O that I may be comprehended into his life and overshadowed with his glory;
sanctified throughout by his Word, and raised up by his eternal power.`"

--

As he patiently endured this season of refinement and purging,
he experienced the old man and his deeds to be crucified,
with the lusts and affections thereof; and through divine condescension,
the prayer of his soul was granted,
the Lord giving him a new heart and that peace which
surpasses the comprehension of unregenerate men.
Thus, as a vessel sanctified and prepared for the Master`'s use,
he received a call from on high to publish the way
of salvation through a crucified and risen Saviour,
and to call sinners to repentance;
that they might receive pardon for their past sins through the atoning blood of Jesus,
and power through his Spirit,
to walk in newness of life and to serve the Lord in reverence and godly fear.
He no longer preached under the benumbing influence
of barren speculation and mere human acquirements,
but from the constraining love of Christ,
and with the animating energy of living heartfelt experience;
and the Lord blessed his labours with great success.

It was about the twenty-third year of his age that he thus came
forth as a minister of the Gospel in the Society of Friends;
and not long after,
he believed himself called to leave his beloved wife and domestic comforts,
and travel abroad in the service of his Lord and Master.
His first journey appears to have been undertaken in 1654;
when in company with Thomas Airey, he visited the city of Bristol,
and found an opportunity to preach the Gospel in
the meetings of the Independents and Baptists,
as well as to some others.
A number of persons were so well satisfied with the
plain and practical doctrine which he delivered,
that they cordially embraced it and became united to the Society of Friends.
The travellers proceeded to Plymouth in Devonshire, and from there to London,
delivering the Gospel message with which they were entrusted,
where and as the Lord moved them.
John Audland did not remain long in London,
feeling himself called to further labour in the city of Bristol,
where he believed the Lord had many seeking souls;
and in company with his intimate friend John Camm, he proceeded there.

In the preceding memoir,
mention has been made of the great multitudes who flocked to hear them,
and the extraordinary convincement which took place--no
meetinghouse being sufficient to hold the auditory,
they held the meetings in the fields, and John Audland having a clear and strong voice,
exerted himself greatly, so that all might hear,
sometimes for the space of several hours,
by which his natural strength was much exhausted and his lungs injured.
Of this visit, Charles Marshall remarks:

[.embedded-content-document]
--

These two faithful ministers of Christ Jesus,
came to the city of Bristol in the fifth month, 1654,
and first went among a seeking people who kept one day in the week in fasting and praying,
waiting for and breathing after the visitation of God and his day of redemption.
They spoke the powerful word of life among us,
in the dread of His name who lives forever, and we were smitten even to the heart.
That day, and the visitation of it overtook us, which we had longed and waited for;
and we were turned from darkness to the marvellous light of the Lord.
We had some meetings before the more general gathering, in and about that city;
which began on this wise.
On a first-day morning,
I went with these two servants of God about a mile and a half from the city,
to a little spring of water, where I had spent many solitary hours in my tender years,
seeking the Lord.
We sat down and drunk of the spring, and after some hours of the morning were spent,
I perceived that they were under a great travail of spirit,
and John Audland said with trembling, Let us be going into the city.

We came to a house in Broad Mead street, where several people were met together,
inquiring for these two men.
John Audland asked if anyone there had an interest in a field;
and an ancient man saying he had a field pretty near,
notice was given to the people in the house; and as we went along,
people in the street went also to the field, called Earl`'s Mead.
There were a pretty number came, and John Camm began to speak tenderly and in great zeal,
directing to the heavenly grace of God, and testifying against sin and iniquity,
to which some were attentive.

I perceived a great exercise of spirit in my dear friend and father in Christ Jesus,
John Audland, who trembled very much.
After dear John Camm had done, he stood up,
full of dread and with a shining brightness on his countenance,
and lifting up his voice as a trumpet, said,
"`I proclaim spiritual war with the inhabitants of the earth
who are in the fall and separation from God.`"
Then he went on in the mighty power of God, opening the way of life.
O the seizings of soul and prickings at heart, which attended that season!
Some fell on the ground,
and others cried out under the sense of their states as opened by him.
Indeed it was a notable day, worthy to be left on record,
that our children may read and tell to their children
the worthy and noble acts of our God.

--

Sewel, in his [.book-title]#History of Friends,#
makes mention of this meeting as an occasion in which the Lord`'s power
was eminently manifested for the awakening and convincement of the people.

After this he several times visited Bristol,
and travelled through the western counties of England, accompanied by his beloved friend,
John Camm,
where many were convinced and remained steadfast and upright
in their attachment to the principles of truth.
He deeply felt the loss he sustained in the decease of John Camm;
their hearts being knit together in Christian love, and united in concern,
above all other considerations,
for the glory of God and the gathering of souls unto Christ;
in which blessed service they freely spent their time and strength.

Such were the entire dedication and noble fortitude of many of the early Friends,
that neither the endearments nor the comforts of domestic life,
nor the perils and privations which awaited them, when beating, stoning,
scoffing and abuse were their portion, and often a filthy dungeon their prison house;
could deter them from yielding a ready and cheerful obedience,
when they apprehended their gracious Lord was calling them forth in his service.
Their works abundantly proved that they were actuated by the same spirit
which shone forth so conspicuously in the example of the primitive believers.
Remembering that the time was short and souls exceedingly precious,
they that had wives were as though they had none;
they that bought were as though they possessed not, and they that used the world,
did it as not abusing it.

This description is justly applicable to John Audland and his wife.
Though closely united by the bonds of natural affection as well as Christian love,
and enjoying even more than ordinary happiness in each others`' society,
yet he hesitated not to obey the call of duty, nor she to surrender him freely thereto.
Thus it happened that during the greater part of their married life,
they were deprived of the society of each other,
but their hopes of happiness being built upon the life that is to come,
they were willing to deny themselves even this greatest earthly satisfaction,
in the blessed hope of a glorious reward in that state of
being where sorrow and separation cannot come.

In 1662 we find John Audland again at Bristol, where he was arrested at a meeting,
and with another Friend taken before the mayor.
During the examination which ensued, the oath of allegiance was tendered to them,
and the following discourse occurred.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ Will you take the oath or no?

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_
We are not satisfied that it is lawful for us to
swear because it is against Christ`'s doctrine,
who says, Swear not at all.
But if you will satisfy us, according to the truth, that it is lawful for us to swear,
we will give you a further answer.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ We will not dispute the case with you, but if you would be satisfied,
it must be by some ministers or the bishop of the diocese.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ We shall be very willing to hear the ministers or the bishop,
what they will say to us in this matter--let them come that we may hear them.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ That is not like to be done now.
Will you take the oath or not?

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ We are Christians, and account ourselves bound to abide in Christ`'s doctrine,
who absolutely forbids all swearing;
therefore we desired to be answered by any of you concerning it;
for we have no intention of harm in the least against the king;
neither do we refuse to swear because of any guilt,
for we are innocent in our hearts and consciences;
neither have we given any occasion for which the oath should be offered to us,
for we have walked in all good conscience peaceably.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ You must obey the king`'s laws, and go to church, and hear divine service.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ We do go to church, and hear divine service.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ What church, a house or a barn?

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ No, we do not call a house or a barn a church.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ What is a church then?

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ The household of faith, who are sanctified in Christ Jesus,
that meet together in the name and fear of the Lord,
and worship him in spirit and in truth.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ So: well, you are required here to take the oath, and if you will do it,
answer us, or deny us, which if you refuse we must commit you.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ We are not resolved that it is lawful for us to swear,
and therefore if you do commit us, we shall willingly suffer,
and keep our consciences clear in the will of the Lord, rather than sin against God.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ Well, hold them the book.

[.offset]
A man brought the book, and said, Here, will you lay your hands on the book?

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ When we have occasion: but that book forbids all swearing.

Then one of them taking the book in his hand, would have turned to a place in it.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ Take the book from him: he will bring a place against swearing.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ Do you not profess yourselves Christians?
Will you not own the doctrine of Christ and his apostles?

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ We have a law that you must swear, and therefore you refusing, must go to jail.
Clerk, make a court order.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ Well, but hear us, will you commit us for owning the doctrine of Christ?
You had no occasion to offer us the oath, for we are peaceable men,
and were not seen in any tumultuous meeting, neither have we absolutely refused,
but only desired you to answer the thing, because we fear the Lord,
and an oath to us is matter of conscience.
Therefore you should be tender in such cases,
and take heed of acting any thing against your knowledge, or to the hurt of the innocent;
for we desire the good of you all, that you may do justly and fear the Lord,
that when you come to give your account to him, it may not be with grief.

[.discourse-part]
_One of the magistrates:_ Don`'t hear them, Mr. Mayor;
they would have all such as themselves.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ Paul, when he was before the king and rulers,
desired they had been altogether such as he was, except his bonds.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ Ay, but Paul was no Quaker.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ Paul was a Christian, and he said himself,
that he was with the Corinthians in fear and much trembling.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ No, Paul was no Quaker: the pharisees were Quakers.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ The pharisees were persecutors, and haled the servants of God before rulers,
and resisted the holy One and the Just,
and persecuted them that met in the name of Jesus.

[.discourse-part]
_Mayor:_ Don`'t hear them: take them away, jailer.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ Well, we are willing to suffer for the testimony of a good conscience,
and we desire nothing but well to you all; that you may do justly,
and act nothing against the Lord or his people.

[.offset]
So the jailer took them away.

They were accordingly committed to prison; but how long John Audland was detained,
we are not informed.
He also suffered imprisonment for his testimony to the truth, at New-Castle,
and on other occasions, and was often in great jeopardy of his life,
being cruelly beaten and abused by the rude rabble,
as well as the persecuting professors;
but through all the Lord preserved him from serious
harm and kept him faithful and upright to the end.

His unwearied and arduous labours in the Gospel,
together with the hardships and exposures he endured,
produced considerable effect upon a constitution which was naturally not robust,
and he began to show some symptoms of the pulmonary affection,
which in 1663 confined him to the house, and eventually terminated his life.
He was afflicted with a very severe cough,
and often complained of a soreness in his chest,
his lungs appearing to be gradually wasting.
He would often say, "`Ah, those great meetings in the orchard at Bristol!
I may not forget them.
I would so gladly have spread my net over all, and gathered all, that I forgot myself;
never considering the inability of my body.
But it is well--my reward is with me, and I am content to give up and be with the Lord,
for that my soul values above all things else.`"

About three weeks before his decease, a hectic fever came on,
which occasioned him to be very restless, his sleep being taken from him,
yet he was preserved in patience and quietude of mind.
His symptoms becoming worse and indicating the approach of death,
many of his friends came to see him,
and it pleased the Lord to open his mouth in testimony to the truth,
with great strength and clearness,
as though he had been without any sense of his sickness,
to the comfort and refreshment of his hearers.
Often he would be raised upon his knees in bed,
and pour out his supplications to the Lord in behalf of his heritage,
beseeching him to prosper his work in the earth, and especially in that nation.

Sometime before his decease,
he had a remarkable dream or vision concerning John Wilkinson and John Story,
who had been fellow-labourers with him in the Gospel,
but after his death fell away and became a source
of much trouble and distress to their faithful brethren.
This vision having since been fulfilled in a very extraordinary manner,
it seems proper to notice it here.
He saw a large mine, wherein was much precious ore to be dug out,
though it required hard labour to accomplish it;
and the Lord of the mine had called him with many more, to labour in it,
giving them liberty to work in any part of it,
but enjoining that all should bring what they collected into one place,
to be deposited in the same heap.
For a time the work prospered greatly:
the Lord of the mine was well pleased and his labourers had much comfort and joy.
At length he thought he looked behind him on some of his fellow-labourers,
and among them he perceived two,
who began to slacken their diligence and would only work where it was most easy,
and in their own time and will, not regarding the commandment of their Lord.
And not only so, but when these two found a piece of ore more rich and good than usual,
whether it was of their own digging or not,
they would gather it into a private heap of their own, for themselves and their benefit,
and not for their Lord`'s. Upon seeing this,
he cried out in great grief and bitterness of spirit; O Lord,
it was your command that we should all work at your appointment and gather to one heap,
and for a time it was so and your heap increased and the work prospered.
But now,
alas! there are two who have begun to gather to themselves and to their own heap,
and not unto you.
Here the exercise of his spirit was so great that he awoke;
and being fully satisfied that the dream or vision was of the Lord,
it produced a great effect upon his mind,
bowing him under deep sorrow and mourning for these two,
whom he had esteemed as ancients among the people, so that his body trembled greatly,
and he sighed and wept on their behalf.
His wife inquiring what was the occasion of his trouble, he told her weeping,
and expressed his belief that it would be fulfilled in a few years,
which accordingly came to pass.

He continued during the remainder of his time, in a heavenly and gathered state of mind,
often saying there was nothing for which he could desire to live,
but the comfortable enjoyment of his friends in the fellowship and life of truth,
and that he might be helpful to his dear wife, for whose situation,
in the prospect of his removal, he felt a very near and tender sympathy.
Yet in this he said his will was in true subjection to the will of the Lord,
whether for life or death,
and he committed her and the whole flock and heritage
unto God and his holy care and keeping,
saying that He would be a husband to his desolate
widow and a tender Father to his fatherless children.
He often entreated his wife to give him up freely to the disposal of the Almighty,
"`whose,`" said he, "`I am, being made acceptable in his beloved Son.`"

Thus with calm and dignified composure,
did this devoted servant of the Lord finish his short but useful life,
on the 24th of the first month, 1663, in the 33d of his age,
and was interred the following day at Birkrigg Park,
where the remains of his beloved friend John Camm,
had been buried about six years before.

=== A Short Account of Thomas Thompson, Minister of the Gospel, in the Society of Friends

Thomas Thompson, of Skipsea, England,
was convinced of the truth of God by that faithful minister of the Gospel of Christ,
William Dewsbury, in the eighth month of the year 1652,
and shortly after opened his mouth to declare the
name of the Lord and preach repentance to the people.
He was preserved in faithfulness to the truth to the end of his days,
not turning his back from sufferings, but patiently endured reproach for Christ`'s sake,
and spoiling of goods, with many years`' imprisonment.
When it pleased the Lord to visit him with the illness whereof he died,
which began on the 26th day of the sixth month, 1704,
his heart was filled with the love of God, and he was enabled through his goodness,
though very weak in body, to go to several meetings,
in which the Lord`'s heavenly power did livingly attend him.
On the 6th day of the seventh month, he was at the Monthly Meeting held at Harpham,
being the last public meeting he was at,
where he bore a plain and powerful testimony to the ancient truth,
labouring to encourage all Friends to be faithful to God,
and to be diligent in the service of truth,
according to their several abilities and endowments,
that so an increase of the peaceable government of Christ might be witnessed,
both in the particular and also in the general.

He was indeed a laborious man in the work of the Gospel,
having travelled in truth`'s service several times through Scotland,
and in many places in this nation; and, as he said when upon a dying bed,
for many years had not omitted any opportunity of being serviceable.
His testimony was plain, but powerful, sound and convincing,
and severe against wickedness;
but to the young and tenderhearted he was very loving and affectionate,
even as a nurse that cherishes her children.
On the 10th day of the month, in the year abovesaid, being the first-day of the week,
several Friends visited him in his chamber, he being then very weak,
to whom he declared the lovingkindness of God, and of his tender dealings with his soul,
from his youth to that day; and that he felt the Lord,
who had been the guide of his youth, to be the staff of his old age;
exhorting Friends to faithfulness and confidence in God,
that they should depend upon his power and providence forever.

On the 13th day of the month, several Friends being with him,
he said that he was content to live or die, as the Lord pleased, in whom he had peace;
and that he was in no doubt concerning his salvation, but was satisfied forever,
and could say with Job, the Lord had granted him life and favour,
and his visitations still preserved his spirit.
The next day, being the 14th, and the day of his departure out of this world,
he spoke little in the forenoon, being under much bodily weakness and pain at times;
but about the second or third hour in the afternoon, in a heavenly manner, he said,
"`The Lord is my portion, and the lot of my inheritance forever,
I am not dismayed;`" and after a little time, "`I have peace with God;`" and again,
"`Since the day that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, as you are converted,
strengthen your brethren and if you love me, feed my lambs; I have spared no pains,
either in body or spirit,
neither am I conscious to myself of having omitted any opportunity
of being serviceable to truth and Friends;
but have gone through what was before me with willingness;
and now I feel the love of God,
and the returns of peace in my bosom;`" which words were
spoken in so living a sense of God`'s heavenly power,
that it wonderfully broke and tendered Friends present.

Another time he said, "`The Lord Jesus Christ has shed his precious blood for us,
and laid down his life, and became sin for us,
that we might be made the righteous of God in him.
O this is love indeed.`"
Again, "`My heart is filled with the love of God.
Oh the excellency! oh the glory! oh how glorious and excellent is the appearance
of God! the rays of his glory fill his tabernacle:`" and so he sung melodiously,
saying, "`O praises, praises, high praises, and hallelujah to the King of Zion,
who reigns gloriously this day.`"
To a neighbour that came in to see him, he said, "`We must put off these mortal bodies;
but for them that fear the Lord there is an immortal one prepared.`"
He continued very cheerful and sensible to the last,
and spoke very cheerfully to several neighbours who came to see him.
About three quarters of an hour before his death,
he spoke to one that had been under convincement several years,
but had not been faithful,
exhorting him to repent and be faithful to what God had manifested to him,
that so he might find mercy;
telling him that he would find it a terrible thing to appear before an angry God;
and to remember the words of a dying man, and so bid him farewell.
Another time he said to Friends, "`You are my witnesses,
that I have not withheld from you the counsel and mind of God,
but have laboured to provoke you to faithfulness and diligence in his service,
that so you might receive a crown of glory at the hand of the Lord,
which is laid up in store for all the righteous,
and my conscience is clear in God`'s sight.`"
Being filled with the power and love of God, he often praised his holy and glorious name;
and about the seventh hour passed away like a lamb, without either sigh or groan,
and is at rest in the Lord forevermore.

He departed this life in the seventy-third year of his age,
the 14th of the seventh month, 1704.
A labourer in the Gospel about fifty years.

=== Memoir of John Watson

John Watson was born in the year 1651, and came with his father into Ireland, in 1658.
Kilconner, in the county of Carlow, became the family residence.

When about twenty-two years of age,
he was invited to a religious meeting of the Society of Friends at New Garden.
It was the first he had attended, and the ministry of John Burnyeat so touched his heart,
that he joined that Society; and believing he did right in so doing,
was enabled to bear the displeasure of his father,
which was particularly excited by his son`'s adopting their plain mode of speech.

It may now occasion some surprise that this should have given such offense,
but our ancient records inform us of much suffering on that account having been endured,
from within and from without; for severe conflicts of spirit were experienced,
before the will was subdued,
and the mind enabled to overcome its reluctance to bear the cross in this particular:
especially as the singular number was formerly used
in speaking to those of inferior station,
and persons in higher rank, when addressed in this manner,
were accustomed to look upon it as denoting disrespect, and, accordingly, resented it.
Not uncovering the head, in salutation to a fellow creature,
also drew much displeasure on those who forbore to foster that self-complacency
which expected this outward show of respect from those who withheld it,
not from lack of good will or courtesy,
but from the conviction that it was their duty to refrain from paying it,
believing it originated in pride and servility, and tended to encourage these evils.

In 1674, John Watson married Anne Tomlinson,
whose parents had settled in Ireland about the time of his father`'s removal there.
His wife joined herself to the Society of which her husband was a member,
and both patiently endured the father`'s remonstrance
against his son`'s change of his profession of religion.
In these remonstrances he was seconded by archdeacon Plummer, who,
finding persuasion unavailing, threatened him with a prison;
to which threat the pious young man replied: "`I do not fear it,
but will make ready for one;`" and thereupon disposed of some of the land which he occupied,
to lessen his rent and encumbrances.

He lived in his father`'s house, which, in 1675,
becoming his own by the decease of his father,
meetings of Friends were occasionally held there, and regularly established in 1678;
which gave great offense to the archdeacon, and to the bishop of Leighlin and Ferns;
who sued him for refusing to contribute to the repairs
of the parish worship house at Fenagh,
and obtained a writ against him,
which the archdeacon told him should not be put in force, if he would but submit to them,
and not allow meetings in his house.
On his refusal to accede to those terms, he ordered him to prison, cruelly adding:
"`There he shall lie till he rots.`"
He was a prisoner above two years, and besides this suffered in his property,
under pretence of an escape,
because the sheriff had sometimes granted him liberty to visit his own home.
To that home and to his liberty he was at length restored,
and found it was allotted to him to do, as well as to suffer,
in the cause of righteousness;
for in 1696 he believed it to be his duty to preach the Gospel,
and in that service he took several journeys into England, and through this nation;
having meetings in remote places, where none of his religious profession resided.
He was also zealously concerned for the support of
the discipline established among Friends,
and for good order in their families;
in which he gave the example of ruling well his own house, in the spirit of love,
keeping his children in that subjection which tended to promote their own happiness.
As he was an affectionate father, so he was a tender and kind husband to a worthy wife;
and they united in humble submission to the will of the great Disposer,
while they drank of a cup which, had it not been palliated by resignation,
parental feelings would have found very bitter.

Their daughter Elizabeth accompanied a ministering
woman Friend in a journey to the province of Ulster;
and there, remote from her parents, sickened of the small-pox.
On receiving this information, her father went to her.
The state of the roads and posts at that time did not permit the
anxious mother to receive regular intelligence of her situation;
and her child`'s death was first announced to her by the sight of her husband returning,
bringing his daughter`'s horse, with her clothes tied on the side-saddle.
The mother stood a while silent, and then bore this testimony,
honourable to her children, and consoling to herself: "`I have had ten children,
and not one bad one!`"
Elizabeth Watson died at the house of William Gray of Ballyhagen,
in the 25th year of her age.

John Watson was naturally of a mild and affable temper,
yet he was firm in opposing any tendency to violate those testimonies,
the proper support of which required humility and self-denial.

His last illness continued about three months,
in which time he was often exercised in fervent prayer to the Almighty;
giving praises to his holy name for his favours and mercies towards him,
and testifying resignation to his blessed will, saying;
"`If the Lord have not a further service for me, I am willing to die.
I bless God I have a peaceful conscience.
My good God has all along been my strength, my stay, my song and salvation.`"
He was pleased to see his friends, and had often a word of tender advice to them,
especially to the youth, for whose preservation he was much concerned;
and addressing a young minister, he thus advised him: "`Be sure to keep low in your mind,
and little in your own eyes; yet be not fearful, but of a believing heart.
Look not much at others, neither be dismayed at the frowns of any,
but mind truth in yourself.
I have ever found that my peace and safety.`"

Looking tenderly upon his children, he said: "`I leave you to the Lord;
and if you love him above all, he will be your God, as he has been mine.`"
He exhorted his wife, children, and servants,
to treasure up the memory of those seasons in which their minds
participated together of the influence of heavenly good;
to live in love, and the Lord of love would bless them as they kept near him; adding:
"`O Lord! you know I have always depended upon you, and you have never failed me.`"
When the near approach of death caused his voice to be scarcely audible,
he was engaged in advising one of his friends to guard against the snares of wealth,
to content himself with the sufficiency which was granted him, to keep in humility,
and to devote to the service of the Lord that good
understanding which had been given him.
To another he thus expressed himself: "`My heart is united to you,
and to all faithful Friends, as Jonathan`'s was to David.`"
He slept little or none the last night of his life,
but was fervent in prayer on behalf of their small meeting,
and that Friends might be preserved a growing people.
"`Oh! happy,`" said the dying man,
"`is that man or woman who has their work done in their day.
I have nothing to do but to die, and offer up my soul to the Lord.`"
And again: "`I have done, and go in peace with my God.`"
In this happy state, his purified spirit was released, the 19th of first month, 1710,
at his house in Kilconner, in the sixtieth year of his age.

His son Samuel thus bears witness to the character of his deceased father:
"`When I consider his grave and solid deportment in his family,
his great care for our welfare, and good advice to us in tenderness of spirit,
when young in years; as also his earnest concern for the growth of truth,
and preservation of those who professed it,
my spirit is tenderly affected with a sense of the loss,
which both we of his family and the church also sustain,
by the removal of so kind and tender a father and faithful friend.`"

=== Memoir of William Watson

William Watson was born at Crane, in the county of Wexford, in the year 1687,
of parents who were members of the Society of Friends,
and religiously careful of his education, as he thus acknowledges,
in a letter dated 1707: "`Dear parents,
I hope I shall never be unmindful of your great care to me, which you have often, yes,
always made me a sharer of; and though we be often outwardly separated,
yet I hope the Lord, whom, in sincerity, according to my measure,
I desire always to serve, will keep us in such a frame of mind,
that we shall be near to him, and to one another.`"

At sixteen years of age he came forth in the ministry, in which,
as Friends belonging to his Monthly Meeting have recorded of him,
"`he was careful to wait for the motion of the word of life; so that he grew in his gift,
and became an able minister of the Gospel of Christ.`"
They further bear witness to his sound, deliberate, weighty doctrine;
the tender frame of spirit in which he delivered it;
the sweetness of that life and power attending his ministry, and his fervency in prayer;
adding: "`He had not only a gift in the ministry,
but was also well qualified for the discipline; having a due respect to faithful elders,
loving and affectionate to the brethren,
zealously concerned for peace and unity among Friends,
and that backsliders might be admonished,
and judgment set over the heads of transgressors,
according to the good order of the Gospel, yet very desirous of their return.`"
His mild and grave deportment caused him to be in good esteem among his neighbours.

He travelled as a minister several times in his native country, once in Scotland,
and three times in parts of England;
his faithful dedication affording great comfort to his parents,
and to his uncle John Watson.
But it was not permitted them to enjoy, to the end of their days,
the satisfaction of his society, or to leave him after them,
as one whose example might benefit another generation.
In a letter to his mother, he endeavours, in a solemn and tender manner,
to prepare her for the afflicting intelligence of his illness, and proceeds:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

And now, my dear and affectionate mother, I shall give you to understand,
that I have been for some days past but weakly, chiefly occasioned by spitting blood,
which is now stopped for twenty four hours past, or more,
and I am much easier than I was.
I may also let you know that the Almighty,
whose gracious arm has been near to me from my youth, and underneath in all my troubles,
has been mercifully with me in this illness,
sweetening my soul with his customary goodness and lovingkindness,
making me to triumph over death and the grave, in the power of an endless life:
my heart with humility desires to give him the praise,
whom I can truly say I have desired faithfully to serve, in the Gospel of his dear Son,
according to my measure.
Give my dear love to my father and sisters.
I desire the Lord`'s blessing may rest upon them.
Tell them to live loose to this world, and the things thereof, and near to truth,
and make ready for their change.
My dear love is to all Friends in that county, among whom I have often laboured,
and discharged my duty, as far as I know, both to old and young, faithful and unfaithful:
let them take heed how they slight counsel.
So, dear mother, I salute you in tender love, hoping, in the will of God,
to see you once more in that county.

[.signed-section-closing]
I am your loving, affectionate son,

[.signed-section-signature]
William Watson.

--

The above was dated 1715, the last year of his life;
his distemper making a gradual progress, sapping his strength and withering his youth,
but not his spirit, which, more and more purified,
overflowed in written and oral communications,
to the instruction and consolation of his friends.
He was, in the time of health, a diligent attender of meetings,
and observant of the hour appointed;
and when his weakness prevented him leaving his house.
Friends, at his request, occasionally met there, to their mutual comfort;
and at times he appeared among them in a few tender words,
declaring his resignation to the will of God,
and advising to a circumspect waiting upon the Lord.

The men`'s meeting being held at his house a few days before his death,
after it was over he desired some Friends would come into his chamber,
and being supported in his bed, he took his last farewell, thus: "`Dear Friends,
we have had many sweet seasons together,
and now we are near to take leave of one another;
therefore I desire your continued care over the church of Christ;
and you can never be careful over the church of Christ,
unless you are first careful of yourselves, as the apostle Paul said,
when he was taking leave of the elders of the church: '`Take heed unto yourselves,
and to all the flock,
over the which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.`'`"
He also advised Friends to do justly,
love mercy, and walk humbly with God; and added:
"`In your men`'s meetings be not too full of words,
neither usurp authority one over another, nor strive who shall be greatest there;
but dwell low and humble: walk in humility,
and God Almighty be with you and with your families.`"

In this manner he parted with his dear companions,
whose hearts were sorrowful at the prospect of the approaching separation,
and melted with a tender sense of the divine virtue
which influenced the counsels of their dying friend.
He departed this life the 22nd of the twelfth month, 1715,
in the twenty-ninth year of his age.

=== Memoir of John Clibborn

John Clibborn, son of William Clibborn, was born near Cowley, in the county of Durham,
in 1623; and, in the year 1649, went into Ireland, a soldier in Cromwell`'s army.
In 1653, he married Margaret Crow, at Newry, province of Ulster,
and settled at Moate Grenoge, county of Westmeath.
Pride appears to have been one of his faults;
and finding that the people called Quakers had a meetinghouse on his land,
he was much displeased; for he, with many others, looked on them, not only with contempt,
but aversion, and, determining to banish them from his premises,
he resolved to burn their meetinghouse.
Humanity forbade his doing this on the day assigned for general public worship,
when the people might be assembled in the house; but, on another day of the week,
he provided himself with fire, and went there.
To his surprise, he found Friends assembled; and one of them, Thomas Loe, was preaching.
He threw the fire away, went in, sat down behind the door,
and was touched with what he heard.
His wife asking him, on his return, if he had burned the Quakers`' meetinghouse,
he said: "`No; but if you will come to meeting with me next Sunday, and do not like it,
I shall go to church with you the Sunday following.`"

She accompanied her husband to meeting.
Thomas Loe again preached.
Both John Clibborn and his wife received the truth of his doctrine into their hearts,
and became members of that Society which had been
the object of such displeasure and dislike.
This was about the year 1658.
John Clibborn some time after attended a general meeting, in the same meetinghouse;
and perceiving it inconveniently crowded, addressed the assembly: "`Friends,
if you put up with this house now, you shall have a larger next time.`"
And soon after fulfilled his promise, by building, at his own expense, a meetinghouse,
which, with a lot of ground adjoining, for a burial-place,
he bequeathed to Friends forever.
And in this graveyard were deposited the remains of his wife Margaret, in the year 1661.
In 1664 he took to wife Dinah English, daughter of Thomas English, of Turphealm,
county of Westmeath.

He was a man of exemplary conduct, generous and open-hearted,
liberal to the poor of all denominations, and hospitable,
especially to those strangers who came on errands of love, preaching the Gospel of peace;
useful in his own society, and in his neighbourhood, where he was beloved and esteemed.
His situation, in the time of the civil wars in Ireland, was peculiarly perilous;
being only a few miles from Athlone,
where the Irish army had established one of their principal garrisons,
where parties were issued from which distressed the country.
There, also, the Raparees brought their prisoners.

John Clibborn and his friends continued for some time, at great hazard,
to keep up the meeting at his house, where, succouring many,
and endued with patience and courage, he remained, till he was dragged, in the night,
by the hair of his head, from that home which had afforded an asylum to the distressed;
but which was now the spoil of the plunderer and of the flames.
His own life was attempted three times, by those blood-thirsty men, who, at length,
desperate in their wickedness, laid his head on a block, and, raising the hatchet,
prepared to strike the fatal blow.
He requested a little time.
His request was granted.
The pious man kneeled down, and in the words of the first martyr,
prayed that this sin might not be laid to their charge.
He prayed not for his own life.
With the prospect of a better world before him,
and being harassed and persecuted in this, perhaps he did not wish it to be prolonged.

Just then another party arrived, and inquired, "`Who have you got there?`"
The answer was, "`Clibborn.`"
"`Clibborn!`" re-echoed they: "`a hair of his head shall not be touched.`"
Thus escaping with his life, though stripped almost naked,
he wrapped a blanket about him,
presented himself before the officer who commanded the garrison at Athlone,
and informed him of the treatment he had met with.
It is probable that some of the military united with the banditti in those acts of violence;
for the officer desired John Clibborn to point out
the man or men who had committed this outrage,
and they should be hanged before his hall-door.
This the benevolent sufferer refused to do; declaring that, owing them no ill-will,
he desired not to do them the smallest injury, and that all he wanted was,
that his neighbours and himself might be allowed to live unmolested.

This good man saw tranquillity restored to the land,
and thankfully enjoyed that blessing,
which those who have witnessed its interruption can best appreciate.
He was diligent in attention to religious duties, preserved in unity with his friends,
and in love to all mankind, to the end of his long life; which closed,
at the age of eighty-two, the 22nd of fifth month, 1705, at his house at Moate Grenoge.

=== A Narrative of the Life of Edward Chester, By His Wife, Elizabeth Chester

He was religiously inclined from his youth,
having his citizenship then mostly among the Baptists.
About the seventeenth year of his age, his father died intestate; and his mother,
who was a religious woman, committed the care and management of her business to him,
which he readily undertook for her,
and for twelve years conducted it with so much diligence and faithfulness,
that he improved the estate and left her more for her other five children,
all younger than himself, than their father could have given them,
if he had made a will--a good example to young men thus circumstanced.

When he was about eighteen years of age he joined in communion with the Baptists,
and was held in such esteem by the chief of them, that, I,
who then frequented their meetings, have heard them say,
he was likely to be a teacher among them;
and they would often be putting him forward to exercise his gift,
as their manner of speaking was; but I have heard him say,
he waited for a stronger and more powerful impulse on his spirit.
Sometimes through their importunity, he undertook it in their private meetings;
but it brought trouble upon him and an exercise of mind,
for he was not satisfied with the outside of religion.
His spirit travailed after the enjoyment of the substance;
a hunger being begotten in him after that bread which comes down from heaven,
and a thirsting after that water which springs up to eternal life,
and was to be set open, as a fountain to wash in, from sin and from uncleanness.

While his mind was thus exercised, with desires after the Lord,
he was graciously pleased to manifest himself to him in love and with power,
so that I have often heard him say,
he was convinced of the blessed Truth by his own fireside,
as he sat alone bemoaning his condition,
and crying to the Lord for power to overcome those
sins which secretly and so easily beset him.
Under this exercise, the doctrine of the cross of Christ was opened to him,
by the illuminating Spirit of God, by which he clearly saw, and was fully satisfied,
that the way to know and witness redemption and salvation from sin,
was to take up the daily cross; that which crucifies us to the world,
and the world to us, and which crucifies the flesh with the affections and lusts;
and thus to follow the Lord Jesus Christ.

When the sense of this was imprinted on his mind, he cried within himself,
"`alas! have I been a professor of religion so long,
and have not yet known the power of the cross of Christ?
Have I read the Scriptures so often,
and have they been to me all this time but as a sealed book?`"

Some little time before this, he heard of a people in the North of England,
who professed the light and inward manifestations of the Spirit of Truth,
to be their guide and teacher; and he felt a strong desire to know them.

Providence so ordered it, that John Askew, a Friend of London,
brought a young man to his house, whom he since thought was Richard Farnsworth,
with whom he had a conference, to his great satisfaction;
and expressing a wish to have more acquaintance with this people,
then in scorn called Quakers, many of them afterwards called upon him.
His heart being opened by the Lord,
his house was opened also to receive and entertain the servants of the Lord,
at a period when they could hardly get entertainment in some places for their money.

Now that he gave up to follow the Lord,
it pleased the Lord to bless him both inwardly and outwardly;
he was increased in the things of this world,
and grew in the knowledge and obedience of the Truth, and was enabled to suffer for it,
both in the spoiling of his goods and the imprisonment of his body.
For being brought before the justices in Oliver Cromwell`'s time,
for bearing his testimony against the oppressive burden of tithes,
and not having freedom to put off his hat to them, he was committed to prison for it,
and was the first Friend that was sent to Bedford jail on Truth`'s account.

He has often since been a prisoner, but not long at a time,
for being beloved by most who knew him, both justices and others,
because of his innocent life and peaceable and loving behaviour,
his neighbours were always uneasy when he suffered.
One of his persecutors became so much so,
that he went from justice to justice to get him discharged,
and would not come home without him, so mightily did the Lord work for his deliverance.
But he always came forth clear in bearing his testimony, through the Lord`'s assistance,
to whom be the glory.

About a year after his convincement, which was in or near 1654,
it pleased the Lord in his tender love and great compassion to my poor soul,
to beget in me also a sense of my lack of the right knowledge of a Saviour,
to save and preserve me from my sins.
Through the Lord`'s mercy to me,
I could read the Holy Scriptures and was pretty well acquainted with the literal sense;
yet I found I lacked the knowledge of that which
could give me power and strength to fulfill them,
which I saw to be my duty, and that without it I was not fit for the kingdom of heaven.
This brought a great exercise upon my mind, and I may truly say, by night on my bed,
I sought Him whom my soul longed after, but I knew not where to find Him.
I passed nights of sorrow for my misspent time,
though I had never been addicted to gross evils,
having had my education among a sober people.

In this state the Lord was graciously pleased to
hear the cry and regard the panting of my poor soul,
which had breathed after him, even in my tender years.
Blessed be his great name, he appeared in the needful time,
and turned my mind inward to his Holy Spirit,
through the powerful and effectual preaching of the
then contemptible people called Quakers.

By this time meetings were settled at Market street, at Sewell, and at Dunstable,
where my dear husband and I were two of about twelve, who for some time met together,
till the Lord increased our number.
But not one of those twelve, who first sat down there to wait upon the Lord,
now remains but myself only, the rest having laid down their heads, I hope,
in peace with the Lord.

After our little company was somewhat increased,
we still sat together for the most part in silence,
not having a word spoken among us for several months.
Sometimes a ministering Friend was sent by the Lord to visit us with a living testimony,
whereby we were encouraged to wait upon the Lord, and directed where and how to wait,
so as to find him and be accepted of him.
And the Lord`'s presence and power being what we waited for, blessed be his name,
he never sent us altogether empty away; though sometimes we waited long,
before he broke forth in his tendering power and consoling love; which,
when it did break forth, brought into true humility and tenderness,
and begat in us a strong desire and cry after more of the same.
And I can truly say, it was a good day, for the blessed Truth prevailed and prospered.^
footnote:[This narrative presents a view of the simplicity
and devotedness of the Friends of that day,
and the spiritual enjoyment with which they were rewarded.
It holds forth an incitement to the few,
who now assemble in many places for the same object,
to double their diligence and their fervour under the conviction,
that the same happy results would be attained.
Do we not believe, that He with whom there is no variableness neither shadow of turning,
and from whom every good and perfect gift is derived,
continues to grant the aid of his Holy Spirit to the humble dedicated
soul in its sincere efforts to wait for and draw near to Him?
Were this the preeminent object of its desire and pursuit,
the things of this world would be held in their proper place--the
heart would daily expand with living aspirations after God,
and that purity which he requires, and when convened to offer public worship to him,
to whom we owe all we have and all we are, he would graciously draw near to us,
tender our souls with his Divine presence,
and give songs of praise and thanksgiving for the multitude of his mercies and loving-kindnesses,
which he bestows upon his unworthy creatures.
And we have substantial ground to believe,
that enlargement of the number which is now much reduced in some places,
would be one of the consequences of a lively daily devotion,
as it was in the rise of the Society.
It is the spirit of the world in some or other of its fascinating forms,
that is robbing us of those riches, which the key of David only can give access to,
the gold tried in the fire, which makes truly rich;
the white raiment which can only clothe our nakedness;
and the eye-salve that gives clear perception,
both of our own states and of the things which pertain to salvation,
without which all our possessions and attainments will be lighter than vanity,
and avail us nothing._--William Evans_]

After we had thus walked together for several years
in the profession of the blessed Truth,
my dear husband and I took each other in marriage, on the 19th of the fifth month, 1663.
Being the first who were married among Friends in our meeting,
or in this county of Bedford, that we had heard of, we had no track to follow,
and that good order which is now established among Friends was then lacking.
Therefore, we took each other in a public meeting, and had a certificate thereof,
signed by about seven Friends of the meeting,
and we joined in that which through the Lord`'s assistance,
caused us to love and to be faithful to each other, until death.

In the year 1665, it pleased the Lord to bring my husband forth in the ministry,
declaring what he had done for his soul, setting forth the great love of God to man,
and exhorting all to come unto and persevere in the blessed way of Truth,
that they might inherit everlasting life.
And truly his honest, plain testimony made such impression on the people,
and produced such tenderness in them,
that the remembrance of it rests upon me with great satisfaction.
From that time forward,
as the Lord by his constraining love drew him forth and gave him utterance,
he laboured in the service of Truth, and had great travail of spirit,
more especially for the meetings to which he belonged, Market street and Sewell,
where his service mostly lay.
Sometimes he had drawings to visit Friends in other meetings, but always felt a care,
that he might not make that little dispensation of the Gospel,
as he used modestly to call it, which was committed to him, chargeable to any.
He was also much concerned for the recovery of those
who professed the holy Truth and yet walked disorderly,
or not according to it.

His tenderness and love to me I lack words to express;
but this I can with good assurance say, we were true helpmates to one another,
and our love increased to the last, for it stood not in the natural affections only,
but was grounded in that which endures forever.
When the period of our separation drew near,
this made me desire to be thoroughly resigned and
kept subject to the Lord`'s heavenly will,
for therein only could I be comforted on parting with my dear husband,
considering that my loss, was his greatly desired gain;
even that he might be in the full fruition of Divine love in the heavenly mansions,
"`where the wicked cease to trouble and the weary are at rest.`"
Blessed be the name of the Lord, who now as well as formerly, has made in measure,
hard things easy, and bitter things sweet.

In his last sickness he uttered many comfortable expressions,
though it was difficult for him to speak.
He would often say, he felt more of the love of God than he could express,
and he much desired stillness and retirement, saying,
he knew the worth of a quiet habitation.
I felt him in that love of God, which surpasses the love of all things here below,
in which we were joined together by the Lord,
and in the same love the Lord was pleased to separate us, by taking him to himself,
on the 23rd of the twelfth month, 1707, in the seventy-fourth year of his age.
And now my desire is, that I and the children he has left behind him,
may follow him in that straight and narrow way, which we took delight to walk in,
until we arrive at our journey`'s end in true peace with the Lord.

This was upon my mind to write, in commemoration of the Lord`'s gracious dealings,
in the remembrance of his goodness to us in our tender years,
how he shed abroad his love in our hearts when we were but young,
which drew us to love him again,
and not to think anything too dear to part with for his name and truth`'s sake.
Surely we had good cause to say, He remembered the kindness of our youth,
when we followed him in a land that was not sown, through briars and thorns.
Hitherto he has been the support of our youth and the stay of our old age,
and has helped my dear companion to become more than a conqueror,
through Jesus Christ who loved him; and that it may be so with me also,
and with all who love the Truth in sincerity,
is the earnest desire and fervent breathing of my soul to God.

=== Memoir of Robert Sandham

Robert Sandham, a faithful elder, was born at Woodcutt, in Sussex, in the year 1620.
Being of a pious disposition, he joined in society with the strictest Baptists,
who at that time were a tender and persecuted people,
among whom he underwent mockings and stoning in the streets.
He was very zealous in his profession, travelling on foot with the ministers;
but in process of time, finding that while this people adhered to forms,
they had too much lost the power of religion which he first felt among them--his anxious
soul panted after a further manifestation of Truth and a closer communion with his Maker.
He came to Ireland a lieutenant of a regiment of foot,
and arrived at Youghal in the year 1652;
where he married a woman who afterwards became a faithful Friend.
He was convinced of the Truth by the ministry of Elizabeth Fletcher,
who preached in the streets of that town in 1655,
and a few years afterwards he was imprisoned in Cork for refusing to swear as a juror,
and fined five pounds,
for which they took from him a horse worth more than double the amount.

In 1662,
he was introduced into much serious thoughtfulness whether
Cork or Youghal should be the place of his residence.
The former presented a prospect of the greatest advantage
as regarded the acquisition of riches,
but Youghal appeared to him to be the place where he would be most useful as a Christian.
The meeting there had become reduced in number and strength,
whereas that at Cork was larger and embraced many substantial members.
Under these considerations he gave up in faith to settle at Youghal,
trusting to Divine Providence for a blessing on his
efforts to provide a subsistence for his family.
The meeting was held at his house, but persecution soon assailed the little company,
a sentinel was placed at the door to keep them from
assembling for the reasonable service of Divine worship,
and he with his family was commanded by the governor to leave the town.

Being a freeman he asserted his right and refused to obey the unjust command.
The governor however, forcibly sent him away with a guard of soldiers on foot,
to Charleville, twenty-four miles distant, not permitting him to ride his own horse,
though his bodily infirmity required it.
He was brought before Roger Boyle, Lord President of Munster,
who when he read the accusation,
and found that it charged him with nothing but what related to his religious duty,
immediately set him at liberty and he returned to Youghal,
undergoing with patience and courage the reproaches and sufferings which
attended him in the conscientious observance of the law of his God.
He was an example of uprightness in his dealings, of a benevolent spirit,
ready to do good to all,
especially those of the household of faith--zealous
and firm in his testimony for Truth against apostates,
backsliders and false brethren,
and particularly against the blasphemous opinions of Muggleton,
which deluded some to their utter loss as to their place in the Truth.
He was a sharp reprover of disorderly and unfaithful walkers,
but a help and strength to his brethren and the newly convinced,
by administering counsel suited to their conditions.
He died in 1675, in the fifty-fifth year of his age,
being sensible of his approaching close and favoured with a resigned frame of mind.

=== Memoir of John Exham

John Exham, of Charleville, Ireland,
was convinced of the principles of Friends while a soldier, about the year 1658;
and yielding obedience to the manifestations of the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in the soul,
he received a gift in the ministry of the Gospel of life and salvation,
and was zealously engaged in visiting the small gatherings
of Friends at that early period of the Society;
and though he laboured under some natural defect
which impeded in measure the exercise of his gift,
yet he often delivered profound and wholesome doctrine to the people.
About the year 1667,
he proclaimed the necessity of repentance and amendment
of life through the streets of Cork,
having his head covered with hair-cloth and ashes, for which he suffered imprisonment,
and was under a like concern in the same city in the year 1698.

In 1710, being the eighty-first year of his age, and when almost blind,
he gave a singular proof of the fervour and constancy
of his love to the brethren and the cause of Christ,
by performing a religious visit to the greater part of the families of Friends in Ireland;
in which service it was evident to those who were witnesses of it,
that he had the spirit of discernment,
often speaking very pertinently to the conditions of persons,
without having received any information respecting them.
He was a man of an innocent life and conduct, just in his dealings,
merciful to the poor and well beloved by his neighbours and friends.
He continued his residence at Charleville during the war,
through many difficulties and hazards,
and often took opportunities of counselling those who needed the care of their Friends.
He was remarkable for his love of meditation,
spending a portion of every day in retirement.

He was esteemed as having a prophetic gift,
of which his religious service gave many proofs.
While he was performing the family visit, he told one company,
there was among them a youth upon whom the Lord would pour forth his spirit,
and he should visit several nations, which was accomplished;
a young man then present afterwards received a gift in the ministry,
which he exercised to the edification of the churches both at home and abroad.
Another instance in which he was called upon to declare the word of the Lord,
was at a time when a great company were convened at the house of the Earl of Orrery,
at Charleville, then a splendid edifice, spending their time in feasting and mirth.
He felt a religious concern to go to the house and call the people there met to repentance,
which he accordingly did, a crowd following him,
and denounced the Lord`'s judgments and woe to that great house,
that it should be destroyed, and become a habitation for the fowls of the air.
Hereupon the earl`'s servants attempted to drive him away,
but the earl commanded them to let the honest man speak.
Having delivered his message he went away,
but in a little time turned back and called for the earl and said to him,
"`Because you have been kind and loving to the servant of the Lord,
the evil shall not be in your days.`"
The event answered the prediction, for the great house in the time of the wars,
after the decease of the earl, was destroyed by fire,
and visibly became a habitation for the fowls of the air, which built their nests in it.

John Exham died in the ninety-second year of his age,
having been a minister sixty years and retained his zeal and integrity to the end.

=== Memoir of William Garton

William Garton, of Ifield, in Sussex, was an early fruit to God,
a faithful believer in his blessed Truth,
and a servant of the church of Christ--zealous against all unrighteousness,
and for the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace among brethren.
He was an elder indeed, watching for good over the flock,
a sympathizer with the afflicted, and a mourner in the house of mourning: a plain man,
more in deed than in words, yet endowed with a good understanding and sound judgment,
which was proved in difficult cases.
In the time of suffering and persecution he was firm and constant in spirit,
preferring the service of Truth and the testimony of it, before all worldly things.
He was an example in the church and in his family, a tender parent,
and had a just care that his children might be trained up in the
fear of the Lord and the knowledge of his blessed Truth;
which labour the Lord was pleased to answer to his satisfaction.
He often said, the greatest portion he desired of the Lord for his children was,
the blessed Truth; and that they might love, fear and serve the Lord,
and then he did not fear that they would lack any good thing.

Two days before his death, being visited by a Friend, he said,
he had always endeavoured for the prosperity of the Truth to the best of his understanding,
and that he had nothing of trouble upon him,
but blessed God that he had an opportunity to give this
testimony to those present--exhorting an ancient Friend,
to keep low in God`'s fear, and make strait steps,
that he might lay down his grey hairs in peace.

He also said he felt the Lord to come in upon his spirit,
and after praying for his wife and children, he said, "`O Lord!
I pray you, remember the ancients, that they may still hold on their way; and oh my God,
if it stand with your will, visit more and more those who are not of your fold,
and bring them in by your arm, that they may come to know rest for their souls;
and that at the last we may be bound up together in the bundle of life.`"

To his daughter he said, "`dear child, I have known much of the goodness of the Lord,
but not in such a large manner before as now--the very fountain is open,
and the love of God is over all; praises, praises to the Lord.`"
He departed the 8th of the seventh month, 1701, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.

=== Memoir of Thomas Lloyd

Thomas Lloyd, of Maumore, in Wales, was educated at the university of Cambridge,
and after his marriage removed with his family to Pennsylvania;
of which province he was deputy governor several years.
In the latter part of his life he had a share in the difficulties
and exercises occasioned by the mournful defection of George Keith.

On his death bed he said to his friends when near his close, "`Friends, I love you all;
I am going from you, and I die in unity and love to all faithful Friends.
I have fought a good fight, I have kept the faith,
which stands not in the wisdom of words, but in the power of God.
I have fought, not for contention and strife, but for the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the simplicity of the Gospel; I lay down my head in peace,
and desire you may all do so; Friends, farewell all.`"
In a message of love to Friends in England, he says, "`I have lived in unity with them,
and desire the Lord to keep them faithful unto the end in the simplicity of the Gospel.`"
He died in 1694, aged about forty-five years.

[.centered]
=== Memoir of Giles Barnardiston

Giles Barnardiston, of Clare, in the county of Suffolk, born about the year 1624,
was an eminent instance of the power of the grace of God in subduing the heart,
and humbling the man to the teachable condition of a little child.
His parents, who were persons of repute in the world,
gave him an education consistent with their rank.
After passing through the common schools he was placed at the university,
where he pursued his studies six years,
with the object of taking the office of a minister in the church.

In childhood he was convicted by the reproofs of the Holy Spirit for doing wrong,
however secret his actions;
and was made sensible that it was the will of his heavenly Father
he should forsake evil and live in conformity to his requisitions.
But it was his unhappiness not to know at that time what it was that thus
reproved him for vice and attracted him to the paths of virtue;
many of the preachers of that day deriding the doctrine of the
immediate communications of the Holy Spirit in the heart of man.
After finishing his studies, and according to the judgment of his friends,
to become qualified to fill the office of a minister,
an offer of a living was made to him, but he felt reluctant to assume such a charge.
Not having submitted to the heart-changing power of Divine grace,
he was conscious of lacking that purity and those spiritual gifts and qualifications,
which he conceived the Scriptures point out as essential to the office of a Gospel minister;
and regarding the functions as too solemn and weighty
to be entered on in his present state,
he rejected the solicitations of his friends to accept the berth provided for him,
and thus incurred their displeasure,
being persuaded that no lucrative motive should influence in such a decision.

Notwithstanding the correctness of his conclusion respecting the priests`' office,
he had not attained the stability to resist the allurements of pleasure,
and accordingly indulged in sensual gratifications
and the pastimes and recreations of the day.
But he was not permitted to pass without condemnation
from the swift witness against sin in his own breast,
which brought him under remorse and anguish for his evil courses.
At the breaking out of the civil war between Charles I. and the parliament,
he obtained a colonel`'s commission in the army.
Though he acquired the reputation of being skillful in military tactics,
he became disgusted with violence and bloodshed,
and the torrent of wickedness which threatened to overwhelm the nation.
He threw up his commission and retired to Wormingford Lodge, in Essex; where,
in privacy and solitude, he applied himself to serious meditation,
relinquishing all his former amusements and living a stricter life.
He often remarked to his friends after his reformation,
that he had no real enjoyment in the midst of his mirth and merriment,
but bitterness and a sting were the fruit of all his sports;
he had no rest or peace going out or coming in, lying down or rising up.

In his present seclusion desires were raised in his soul after the Lord,
and that he would show him the path of life and lead him in the way everlasting.
He was now fully sensible that the way in which he
had walked led to the chambers of death,
and his steps took hold on hell;
and he resolved that if he could but find out the path of everlasting life,
and the people who were seeking the Lord with their whole heart,
he would unite and diligently seek with them;
for he saw through all mere outside profession.
He had known in time past his merriment turned into sadness,
and sometimes mourning and tears,
and his mind awakened to a consideration of an eternal state,
and the account he must one day give of the deeds of this life; and now he was aroused,
under the renewed visitation of the light and grace of Christ,
by which his deeds of darkness were manifested and reproved,
to enter into a fervent search after those things which make for peace and salvation.

In this state of mind he felt an inclination to inquire into the principles of Friends,
and accordingly invited some of them to his house.
George Fox, junior, then at Colchester, took George Wetherly and paid him a visit,
and they were kindly received.
They entered into conversation upon the doctrines of the Gospel; whereupon George Fox,
as related by John Furly, testified, "`That Christ Jesus, the Light of the world,
who tasted death for every man, did also in his universal love to all mankind,
enlighten them, to the end that none should perish and abide in darkness,
but through believing in and following him, they might have the light of life,
and so come to the knowledge of the Truth and be saved--that for men to
despise this inshining light of Christ Jesus in their hearts and consciences,
was to reject their own mercy,
choose their own delusions and neglect their own salvation; yes,
to reject Christ Jesus himself, who according to his gracious words at his departure,
promised that '`he is with you and shall be in you;`' and who in
tender mercy and good will to the sons and daughters of men,
was come near to visit them, to preserve their feet from falling,
and their souls from death; by which tender the Lord is clear from all men`'s blood,
and their destruction is of themselves.
This being the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil;
and the light of Christ Jesus, judging, reproving, detecting,
convincing and arraigning them for sin and evil,
by resisting it they become enemies thereto, as the apostle testified,
through wicked works.`"

This testimony, confirmed by the Holy Scriptures and his own experience,
was received and embraced by Giles Barnardiston.
His understanding was afresh illuminated to see the
corrupt state of his conduct in the world;
and consulting no longer with flesh and blood,
he thenceforth renounced the vanities and unprofitable
associates and pleasures in which he had taken delight,
and submitting to the yoke of Christ he became the companion of the self-denying Quakers,
in following him who is meek and low of heart.
Relinquishing the glory and the friendships of this world,
of which he might have partaken largely from his rank in life,
his talents and acquirements,
he frequented the religious meetings of those who feared the Lord,
though regarded as men of low degree,
and in a little time he became a good example of humility and self-denial,
and of constancy in supporting their meetings through
a scene of almost unparalleled persecution.

In the town of Colchester Friends were undergoing much suffering
at the time he commenced attending their meetings.
The mayor exerted all his influence to distress and scatter them.
After breaking up their meeting by force, and committing many to prison,
a party of the country troops were employed to carry
on the work of destruction more effectually.
They broke up the seats and the windows of the meetinghouse,
beat some of those assembled there and carried others to prison.
Being kept out of the house, Friends collected in the street,
regularly on first and fourth-days, sometimes in cold and rain,
and there held their meetings for the worship of Almighty God,
not being easy in their consciences to decline this duty,
although they were exposed to great injury, and even the loss of life.
On the 6th of the tenth month, 1662, a troop of horse, armed with swords and pistols,
rode furiously among them, beating with drawn swords old and young, male and female,
by which many were much injured.
They returned the following week, having provided themselves with clubs,
in addition to their former weapons, and with these knocked down many,
some of whom lay for a time as dead; and many were so disabled,
that they could not take off their clothes, nor feed themselves for several days.
These outrages were repeated for several weeks,
in which time a number of aged persons were disabled.
Solomon Fromantel was so beaten, that he lost much blood,
and his wife fearing the troopers would kill him,
threw herself upon him to defend him from their blows, many of which she received.
Her father was knocked down and survived the blow but a few days.

Among these valiant sufferers for the truth and the testimony of a good conscience,
was Giles Barnardiston,
who undauntedly hazarded his life in the hottest times of this persecution.
He suffered affliction with the people of God,
in preference to the enjoyment of the pleasures of sin;
and esteeming the reproaches of Christ,
greater riches than the treasures and friendships of the
world--he never turned his back in the evil day,
but by the meekness of his spirit and patient endurance of their rage,
he overcame his persecutors, so that many of them afterwards loved him;
verifying the Scripture testimony, that "`when a man`'s ways please the Lord,
he makes his enemies to be at peace with him.`"

Having now entered into connection with the Society of Friends,
and participated in their afflictions,
he was established in their principles and took part in the discipline of the church.
As he grew in grace, he was furnished with wisdom and discernment,
and became zealous for the cause of Truth,
that the government thereof might be established in the
churches which were gathered into the name of the Lord Jesus.
It was his joy to see men and women serve the Lord in their generation,
and that there might be a care in them to watch over the heritage of God for good everywhere.
He encouraged such daily,
and his estate and time were given up to serve the Lord and his people;
he was very little employed in temporal business;
but his heart and hands were open to do good wherever he saw need.
The care of the churches came upon him, and that purity and righteousness might prevail,
he laboured night and day.
He would often say to those who were rightly concerned for the testimonies of Truth,
"`Go on in the name and fear of the Lord;
heed not the opposition of such as would be at liberty
to do things which tend not to the glory of God;
but mind God`'s fear, and keep in that spirit which judges down all ungodliness,
and every appearance of evil, so shall you prosper,
and be as instruments in the hand of the Lord, to beat down all ungodliness.`"
"`And the last time I saw his face,`" says one of his friends,
"`his eyes were filled with tears, and he was in a deep travail and exercise,
for one who had gone aside from the truth.`"

When he met with any who were prejudiced against the good order of the Society,
and would destroy all government,
under the pretext of leaving all to their liberty and freedom,
while they were in bondage to a slothful, unfaithful spirit,
he would in great love and tenderness speak to such,
and labour with them for their recovery out of the
snare which the enemy had laid for them,
to hinder them from being serviceable in their day.

In the year 1669, he removed his residence to Clare, in Suffolk,
the place of his nativity, and with his brethren there,
was subjected to another course of persecution.
Upon the publication of the Conventicle act,
the parish officer and an informer came to the meeting of Haverill,
where Giles Barnardiston attended, and taking the names of the Friends,
reported them to a justice of the peace, who issued his warrants for distress so often,
that all the estates of the members there, were thought too little to satisfy them.
The warrants were executed with the utmost rigour--the
parish officer urging the informer and others,
saying, "`Come, sirs, let us do what we do quickly, for this trade will not last long.`"
After taking all the goods out of one Friend`'s house, and the wood from his yard,
a neighbour desired them to leave a few old hoop-poles to boil milk for the children,
but they refused.
From another they took the team of horses from his plough;
and when they had made a spoil of a weaver`'s goods,
they broke his loom in pieces with the work in it,
which was his only means to get bread for himself, a sick wife and young child.
From twelve persons, of whom Giles Barnardiston was one,
they distrained goods valued at two hundred and sixty-one pounds sterling.
Friends were not only compelled to endure great loss of property,
but in some cases were even reduced to poverty;
yet they bore it with the meekness and constancy of Christians.
They could not forsake the assembling of themselves together,
but manifested their love and allegiance to their Lord and Master,
by publicly offering that worship, which is due to Him,
of whom and by whom are all things,
and to whom we owe the dedication of our time and talents,
and the right occupancy of those spiritual gifts,
which he dispenses for the edification of the church
and the work of our own souls`' salvation.

After all this spoiling of goods,
the Friends were kept out of their meetinghouse six months together, in winter,
when they met in the open street, as constantly as before, and underwent much abuse.
Two watchmen with halberts, pushed them up and down the streets,
frequently striking and threatening to kill them,
asserting that the justices told them the law could
not punish them if they did kill the Friends.
One of the watchmen falling sick,
was relieved by some of those whom he had been engaged in abusing.
Their charity and Christian kindness in rendering good for evil,
so wrought upon his comrade,
that he refused to continue his outrageous treatment any longer;
and one day meeting a Friend whom he had abused, he said,
"`I desire you to forgive me--the blessing of God is among you.`"
Although they employed another to pursue the same course,
the patience and mildness of Friends overpowered him,
and he finally took his seat on the threshold of
the meetinghouse during the time of their worship.

John Cornwell, who removed to Clare with Giles Barnardiston,
bears testimony to the exercise of mind which he was brought under,
that the Lord would raise up a people in that town
who should become servants of the living God;
and when through the power of the Holy Spirit they triumphed over their enemies,
for which this devoted servant of Christ often praised and
magnified the name of the Lord in commemoration thereof,
it pleased his Divine Master to confer upon him a gift in
the ministry of the Gospel of life and salvation.
He was made an instrument in his hand to turn many from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan unto God,
that they might receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified;
and he lived to see many of his children in the faith of Christ,
some of whose mouths the Lord also opened to declare his everlasting Gospel,
to his great rejoicing while he remained among them.

Giles Barnardiston was an able minister, not of the letter but of the Spirit,
endued with a boldness and utterance which carried conviction to the hearts of many;
he could speak a word in season to them that were weary,
and from his own experience could show them where
true rest and peace to the soul was to be obtained;
in the dread and authority of the Lord he threshed the mount of Esau,
the habitations of wickedness;
and at other times spoke comfortably to the wrestling seed,
binding up that which was bruised, strengthening and confirming the weak and feeble,
and comforting the dejected with the same comfort with which,
in the day of his deep conflicts, he had been comforted of God.
His doctrine was sound, delivered in the simplicity of the Truth,
without reliance on his literary acquirements;
and conveying divine life and refreshment to those he ministered
unto.--He preached the free Gospel of Jesus Christ,
"`seeking nothing for himself,
but that in all things he might have a conscience void of offense in the sight of God;
and that the heavenly work which the Lord had begun in that
age might be carried on and prospered in the earth,
until it should be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters fill the sea.`"
He was a man of a meek, humble, peaceable and tender spirit; and sought the glory of God,
and the good of souls in all he did.
Self was baptized into death, and made of no reputation to him;
he greatly loved and honoured his elder brethren in the Lord,
and was willing to serve the meanest and poorest among the flock of Christ.
He greatly sought for love, peace and unity among brethren;
and that spirit which would divide and sow discord, and lead into a separation,
he stood firmly against.

Very little record of his labours has been preserved,
but from the accounts of his friends he was diligently employed
during the short period of his life after joining the Society,
either in suffering for and maintaining the testimonies of Truth within his own meetings,
or in travelling abroad in the ministry.
He visited many parts of his own nation and was also on the continent;
and in all places where he went he left a good report and savour.
John Wilsford speaking of his service, says:

____

We have had sweet fellowship together in our travel in the service of Truth,
several times.
In a late journey of about six weeks in Norfolk, Suffolk,
some parts of Essex and Cambridgeshire, and the isle of Ely,
we had a precious time together; of which my heart is glad in the Lord.
I desire not to forget the sweet unity and the comfortable
and fruitful seasons we had in that journey,
in which our souls were refreshed in the Lord and with his children.
In almost every meeting we had in this journey,
that faithful servant and minister of the Gospel,
testified that the Lord looked for fruits from his people;
to whom he had so largely manifested himself in making known his precious truth.
He also powerfully exhorted parents to be good examples to their children,
and not to countenance them in the least appearance of evil,
nor in the world`'s vain fashions or customs, manners or language;
but to bring them up in the fear of God, and to teach them such manners as became Truth,
which are good words and civil behaviour towards all people,
and to keep in their places in the authority of God;
and that children should obey their parents in the Lord,
and not to answer again when they are reproved.
To the heads of families and their servants, he gave the admonition,
that they should all know their places, and keep in them one towards another;
being good examples in their respective stations, that the Truth be not blamed,
but adorned by all that profess it; mentioning the declaration concerning Abraham,
when the Lord said, "`Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do,
seeing that he shall surely become a great and mighty nation,
and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him,
and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment;
that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him.
____

And he gave it as a charge to Friends to keep justice
and judgment upon the head of the transgressor,
both individually and in general; "`for,`" said he,
"`these are the people whom the Lord will make great,
and they shall be a blessing in his hand to the nations.`"

It appears he also travelled with that eminent minister of Christ, Benjamin Bangs,
who says of him:

[quote]
____

His ministry was very effectual for the gathering of many from darkness to light;
who are at this day as living epistles of his apostleship,
to the praise and honour of God.
He was greatly endued with the power of the Lord and a heavenly understanding,
with whose testimony my soul has been greatly benefited and consoled.
I can do no less than magnify the Lord in the sense thereof,
which flowed through him as a pleasant stream from the fountain of divine life;
which the Lord opened to him,
whereby he would greatly encourage all to persevere towards the habitation of true peace,
warning them not to sit down short of that rest which God had prepared.
Having been with him in his travels,
I cannot forget how he would often remind such who
were convinced of God`'s blessed truth,
not to forget the day of their visitation;
their first love and tenderness towards the Lord,
and where they were when he first made himself known unto them,
and where he had now brought them by his blessed power.
____

To such who had made some progress in the way of Truth,
and for lack of faithfulness to the Lord,
had let something of darkness come over them again, he would say, "`Friends,
do but remember the days that are past,
when you were first convinced of God`'s blessed truth; what tenderness of heart,
and brokenness of spirit was there then towards the Lord,
and what a love was begotten and raised towards one another!
Where would we not have gone, a little to have been together,
to have spoken something of our experience of the goodness of the Lord to us?
Oh! how glad were we but to see the face of one whom the Lord sent
forth to publish the Gospel of glad tidings in our ears!
Come, do but remember!
How came you to forget these days?
Make now a narrow search,
and see what is the matter that you are not so living to God as you were formerly.
Take heed lest the cumbers, or the delights of a fading, perishing world,
steal your affections away from more durable riches.`"
Thus, with much fervency of spirit and great tenderness,
he exhorted all to press after holiness, without which no man can see the Lord.

This worthy servant of the Lord +++[+++continues Benjamin Bangs,]
did not only in preaching the Gospel,
adorn the truth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which he professed,
but also in his solid behaviour, both in words and actions.
His countenance was grave and weighty, his carriage comely,
and he was ever ready to hold forth a helping hand to the weak,
delighting to behold the prosperity of the Truth, and brethren walking in the unity.
____

Though his health and strength were much impaired by frequent attacks of disease,
he travelled diligently when able to be abroad; and Samuel Cater remarks,
that when they were on any hard journey, accompanied with unusual exercise,
Giles Barnardiston would encourage his friends with the observation,
"`this is but for a short time, and we shall have done in this world.
I desire I may be faithful to the end, that I may enjoy that at the hand of the Lord,
for which I received the Truth; for if it had not been to obtain peace of conscience,
while I am in this world, and hopes of everlasting rest with God in the world to come,
I would never have left the glory and pleasures of this world,
which I had and might have had a share of, with them who are in it;
neither would I now leave my house and home, where I have a loving wife,
with all that a man fearing God need to desire, if it was not to obey the Lord,
and make known his blessed truth unto others, that they may come to be saved.
For this cause do I forsake father and mother, wife and estate;
and whoever thinks otherwise of me, with my faithful brethren,
whom God has called into his work, to declare his name and truth among the sons of men,
they are all mistaken of us, and I wish they knew us better.`"

He had a great esteem and respect for all experienced Friends, who abode faithful,
and in particular for ancient and elder brethren, who were in Christ before him,
and had been serviceable to him upon his convincement,
and a strength to him in time of weakness;
and he often expressed his grief to see how ungrateful some were,
to undervalue the testimonies and service of such, who had been fathers in Christ,
to bring them to the knowledge of the Truth, and to build them up therein,
while they were young and tender; of them he would say,
"`The Lord will judge them for it.`"

The numerous trials with which Friends were assailed at the rise of the Society,
involved them in deep suffering for the support of the Christian
testimonies which they promulgated to the world.
Not only the spoiling of their estates, the violence offered to their persons,
which sometimes terminated life,
the malevolence of their opponents in misrepresenting their religious principles--but
when some respite was permitted them from their multiplied grievances,
disaffected or apostatized members rose up against their brethren,
who were engaged in administering the discipline and government of the church;
and in some instances,
denied its religious principles or questioned the soundness of its faith.
Jeffery Bullock, a member of Haverill Monthly Meeting,
to which Giles Barnardiston belonged, forsook the Christian doctrines of Friends,
and denied that the Christ, who died at Jerusalem,
was the Saviour and Judge of the world.
After the requisite labour to reclaim him from the state
of darkness and unbelief into which he had fallen,
the men`'s meeting disowned him from membership, and his heretical opinions,
as ever having been any part of the creed of the Society,
as appears by the following document, transcribed from the minutes of that meeting.

[.embedded-content-document]

[.blurb]
=== For the clearing of the precious truth of God, professed by us, his people called Quakers, from the occasion of stumbling and reproach given by Jeffery Bullock`'s pernicious doctrine, in affirming that he neither expects justification nor condemnation by that Christ that died, or was put to death, at Jerusalem.

These are to certify all Friends and friendly people whom it may concern,
that we testify against this doctrine as stated by him,
as both pernicious and antichristian,
and contrary to plain Scriptures and the constant
testimony faithfully borne among us from the beginning.

For neither do we profess or preach two Christs;
nor yet own justification by any other Christ, or in any other name,
but by and in the name of that one very Christ of God,
of whom the holy prophets and apostles gave witness in the Scriptures of truth,
1 Pet. 3:18;
who was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit overshadowing the virgin Mary;
and was crucified and put to death in the flesh, outside the gates of Jerusalem,
but quickened by the Spirit, whom God raised from the dead.

We must confess with the holy apostles, Acts 13:30, that even by Him, namely,
that very Christ, all that believe are justified from all things,
from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses: and that remission of sins,
justification and salvation,
as then preached in the name of the same Lord Jesus Christ
and by his eternal power and Spirit of our God;
so the same is constantly believed and witnessed among us.

And although the best sense that we can suppose or gather,
as aimed at by the said Jeffery Bullock, is,
that it is not only by the sufferings and death of Christ,
nor by a mere literal knowledge of Christ as after the flesh,
that men can be either completely justified or saved from sin and death,
any more than the apostles or primitive Christians were, but by his life, Spirit,
and power operating in them,
and so by a living and spiritual knowledge of Christ as after the Spirit.
Which, though the truth of this we cannot but own and justify,
yet this cannot excuse the before cited doctrine, as laid down,
which denies justification and condemnation by that Christ that died:
for that supposes another Christ for that end, and so two Christs.^
footnote:["`And therefore the said Jeffery Bullock ought to see his error and recant,
and call back his words which have given occasion of stumbling in Sudbury.`"]

Whereas, the very Christ, the Son of God, is but one,
though he has often and variously manifested himself from the beginning,
as both before he came in the flesh, and in the fulness of time in the flesh, that is,
that body that was prepared for him to do the will of his Father in: and since in Spirit,
for the everlasting salvation and comfort of all them who believe in his name and power,
which by his divine light within, is livingly revealed.

And we confess that this Son of God, our Saviour, Jesus Christ our Lord,
was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, Rom. 1:3-4,
and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness,
by the resurrection from the dead:
and that that very Christ that came of Israel as concerning the flesh, is over all,
God blessed forever, Rom. 9:5. So that he is truly and inseparably God and man,
according to the Scriptures of truth.
And even that very Christ who was crucified and slain,
has God lifted up with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, Acts 5:30-31.

So we confess with the apostles, 1 Cor. 8:6, that to us, is but one God, the Father,
of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
and we by him.^
footnote:[Acts 17:31--"`And God will judge the world in righteousness,
by that Man he has ordained.`"]

And further, we cannot own any such doctrine or words, whomever spoken by,
as tend to undervalue the sufferings, death, and blood of Christ.
For not only a reconciliation was declared and made through his death, Rom. 5:10,
Heb. 2:17, but all his sufferings,
and his being the one universal offering and sacrifice,
did contribute to man`'s redemption,
and the salvation of all that truly believe in his name, Titus 3:5-6.
Though without the washing of regeneration and being born again, John 3:6.
1 Pet. 1:23. of the living Word and Spirit of life,
none do really partake of eternal salvation,
or that redemption which is obtained through the blood of Christ,
who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity.

Jeffery Bullock took great offense at this decisive testimony of Friends,
and wrote a pamphlet, which he called _Antrchrist`'s Transformations Within,
Discovered by the Light Within,_
inveighing against them and the exercise of that authority with
which the church under the direction of its Divine Head is clothed,
to place the judgment of Truth upon those who have made shipwreck of faith,
and broken the bonds of its fellowship.
To this pamphlet Giles Barnardiston wrote a reply, in which he says:

Antichrist`'s transformations within, is setting itself above the Light within,
in such as have departed from it in themselves;
among whom is this Jeffery Bullock with some others,
who went out from us because they were not of us, but went out and so are made manifest.
Had they continued in the Light, they would not have been pushing at us, and it,
for such are at unity with the Light, and in sweet fellowship,
peace and communion one with another; and there is no occasion of stumbling in them,
because they walk in the Light.
These have been much opposed since they were a people gathered by the Light,
to walk in it; the enemy has laboured always to disperse their gatherings,
and to hedge up their path; and when the national priests and others of all sorts,
could effect nothing with their weapons, then have arisen some among ourselves,
who have spoken perverse things to draw others after them.
This is no new thing,
nor would we have any startled and make a wrong judgment
concerning us or the blessed Light,
because thereof, and thus make their bands strong.

With reference to the charge of imposition, Giles Barnardiston says:

[quote]
____

Neither have such forced any, or exercised dominion over the consciences of any,
as Rome and other churches have done, by their coercive power and penal laws;
and so none are likely to be ensnared by the power and authority
given them of God to judge error and blasphemy,
and whatever rises up that is of a contrary nature
to the pure Light and peaceable spirit of righteousness,
which has brought us forth a people to his praise;
among whom is the spirit of judgment and a sound mind; who have the mind of Christ,
and will not be divided from their Husband, their Maker; nor let his judgment depart,
nor his law that he has placed in their hearts,
and his righteousness that he put by his Spirit in their inward parts,
which now go forth to judge unrighteousness and filthiness as well of spirit as of flesh.
This makes the filthy dreamers that despise dominion angry,
and causes them to vent their confusion,
blasphemy and darkness to the manifesting their own shame, as Jeffery Bullock has done,
because judgment is gone forth against him for denying that
Christ that died at Jerusalem to be the Judge and Saviour;
who, having denied him in his workings for our salvation,
we cannot think it strange to see him inveighing against the ministers and elders,
and the form and order in the church, established by the Lord and his power in them.

And as to our testimony to that Christ that died outside the gates at Jerusalem,
we are glad for the truth and our sake, you have printed it,
and our dealings with you in that particular, concerning the opposition to us in it,
and we can leave it to the witness of God in the consciences of them who see it;
and your seeming answer is somewhat answered in what is already written;
and I am willing to add this further, seeing you think you are yet unanswered,
and also for the sake of the simple.
Rome and the priests saying that they own justification
and condemnation by that Christ that died at Jerusalem,
does not make it antichristian doctrine;
and we do not deny the true doctrine that Rome and the priests own,
but the antichristian.
It is not contrary to the Scriptures and the form of sound words,
to expect justification and condemnation, by that Christ that died at Jerusalem,
but agreeing therewith; and your subtlety is seen,
in making these expressions to exclude the manhood in which it is really included,
which says, "`by grace you are saved,
and therefore not by him that died,`" though he was full of grace,
and by it tasted death, that he might reconcile unto God,
without which there is no salvation.

Jeffrey Bullock says,
"`And by the light of the world we are condemned,`"
as if it was not he who died who said,
"`I am the light of the world.`"
I might as well say, because it is said,
the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent`'s head, therefore not the seed of God;
and a man shall be for a hiding place, and a covert from the storm, therefore not Christ:
the son of man`'s coming is as the lightening, therefore not the Spirit;
God shall judge the world by that man Christ Jesus, therefore not by the light;
this is contrary to the sense of Scripture, for that includes them in one,
and joins them together, whom you would part asunder.
You may read in John, when Christ said,
"`The son of man must be lifted up;`" and they asked him,
"`Who is this son of man;`" his answer was,
"`Yet a little while and the light is with you; while you have the light,
walk in "`it. Likewise, when the babe was brought to Simeon, he took it in his arms,
saying of it, "`My eyes have seen your salvation, a light to lighten the Gentiles,`" etc.
And the prophet speaking of him, says, "`And you Bethlehem Ephratah,
though you be little among the thousands of Judah, out of you shall he come forth,
who shall be ruler of my people Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old,
from everlasting.`"
So he that came out of Bethlehem, was he that died at Jerusalem,
who is the ruler that judges and condemns, who was from everlasting.
So the Gentiles who were in the world before that body came in it,
need not perish for lack of salvation; for his goings forth were from of old,
from everlasting; and God`'s anointed is spoken of, which is Christ,
before his coming in that body.

You tell us,
"`Only all the world was freed from their offerings for sin by that one offering,
and that only has an also too, they were outwardly reconciled by the death of his Son.`"
And was not he who was the one offering for sin, that ended all other offerings,
the justifier, condemner, and Saviour?
Why did he put an end by it to all other offerings,
but because they were faulty and had not efficacy in them to justify and save?
He that reconciles to God by his death, must needs be the alone justifier and Saviour,
and there is not another.

Our testimony has always had a reverent esteem of that precious
blood that was spilled outside the gates,
as being of great value in the sight of the Lord,
and having a testimony in it towards the remission of sin,
to oblige all that are sensible of the end thereof, not to live unto themselves,
but unto him who died for them.
And as they are to be blamed who will not come to the light, but cry it down,
relying upon the death and sufferings without it,
so are you who pretend to cry up the light,
to render the lovingkindness of the Lord invalid,
in sending his Son to lay down his life and precious blood, and taste death for mankind.
Such as speak from the light, which is the life, that was in that blessed body,
can never disregard, but have a high esteem of what he did and suffered therein.

"`An antichrist,`" says Jeffrey Bullock, "`strives to bring in his doctrine,
and would be head over all those invisible appearances that come from God, yes,
and visible appearances also;`" which, I reply, is fulfilled in you and your brethren,
who are judging his ministers,
and the wholesome order and commendable form in the church, to lay them waste.
Indeed, that spirit has not left unattempted the Scriptures themselves,
that so all outward footsteps in the goings forth of the light being abolished,
and the motions and whimsies from antichrists`' transformations set up in their place,
the true Light and Spirit might thereby be abolished also;
and that is the word of Truth in my heart,
to that Spirit whose workings have been to that end.
So your work is seen and judgment gone forth against that spirit, which it cannot escape;
and the judgment of the Quarterly Meeting is true, and will stand over your head forever,
except you repent.
And whereas you disown that body or church,
who looks upon itself to have power to judge of errors,
and has not power to convince of errors, etc.--I answer,
that the power by which the ministers and elders among us, do, and have judged errors,
the same has convinced thousands of errors and false doctrines,
and I believe even you also, in years past, when you were little and tender.
There is a difference between a conscience truly tender unto God,
and that which is seared and hardened through enmity,
which is to be judged and condemned by the church, and such as make strife and division,
to be marked by them who keep in the power.

The reply of Giles Barnardiston, notices many other absurd and unscriptural sentiments,
contained in J. Bullock`'s pamphlet of little interest at this day.
What has been extracted,
shows the completeness of the faith of Friends from the beginning,
respecting the Divinity and manhood of the Lord Jesus Christ,
both as he was the one great offering for sin,
and the Light which enlightens every man that comes into the world, our Redeemer,
Advocate, and Saviour, and will be our Judge, according to that we have done,
whether it be good or evil.

John Wilkinson and John Story, having succeeded with other disaffected members,
in making a separation in the Society, after various labours to reclaim them,
a meeting was held at Ellis Hookes`' chamber, in London, which issued a document,
dated 12th of fourth month, 1677,
testifying against them and their disorganizing proceedings.
It appears that Giles Barnardiston united with his brethren and signed this testimony.

These unsettled people, desirous of strengthening themselves by drawing into their ranks,
those who had denied the principles, or violated the peace and order of the Society,
wrote to Jeffery Bullock for several copies of his pamphlets.
In the letter, dated Chippingham, 4th of tenth month, 1679, they say,
"`Barnardiston and others have been here, and besides,
their envious darts fly secretly and swiftly.`"
This scornful notice of that faithful servant of the church of Christ,
though designed to vilify him, shows his diligence and energy,
in endeavouring to arrest the spread of that evil spirit,
and to maintain the doctrines and cause of Truth over their heads.

Either by the labour of his friends,
or the secret convictions of the Holy Spirit upon his heart,
Jeffery Bullock was brought to see and condemn the errors into which he had fallen;
and in the year 1686,
he gave forth "`several testimonies against that evil spirit by
which he had been led to oppose the truth and people of God,
both by word, writing, and printed books, for several years past.`"
The following is extracted from it:--

[.embedded-content-document.testimony]

[.signed-section-context-open]
Sudbury, the 25th of eighth month, 1686.

Whereas, in an hour of darkness and temptation,
I have been drawn forth by the enemy of my soul, that has led me out in envy, enmity,
and great willfulness,
through my departing from the holy light and pure witness of God in my own conscience,
to write, and cause to be printed and published, several books and papers,
which were unsound, pernicious, and contrary to truth,
in reproach of God`'s truth and people, and their holy way and order,
into which truth had led and settled them; and not only so,
but have also defamed the children of truth, and enviously opposed them,
not only by writing, but publicly in meetings;
and by retaining the counsel of the adversary of my soul,
was carried on further to that ungodly act, in willfulness and stubbornness,
to break that holy command of Christ, who says,
"`Swear not at all,`" yet contradictory to the witness of God in my conscience,
I did swear; and now after all these my wicked doings, the pure witness of God is risen,
and has set all these my sins in order before me, and sin now is my soul`'s burden.

Therefore, that my soul may find ease, and favour and forgiveness of God,
in humility of heart, and contriteness of soul, I do condemn all these my wicked works;
and that it may be clearly and particularly evidenced,
I condemn by name all my said books, namely,

Giles Barnardiston`'s signature stands first in the testimony against that misguided man,
and from the circumstance of his replying to Jeffery Bullock`'s attack upon the meeting,
it is probable that the burden of labouring with him for his restoration,
and the defense of the Christian soundness of the Society,
fell very much upon this devoted servant of Christ.
He lived but a short period after the event;
but from the little account preserved of his movements,
it appears he filled up his day in doing or suffering for the Truth.
J+++.+++ Whiting mentions, that in company with his countryman, William Bennet,
he came to Bristol about the year 1677,
and after this visit he suffered imprisonment in
London in the course of the ensuing three years,
the time of his commitment not being known.
Upon his release, he went to Chelmsford, in Essex, and was taken ill.
His sickness was short, in which he said the Lord was his portion;
and having served God in his generation,
he was made a partaker of that mercy and salvation which
is dispensed to the obedient and sanctified soul,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
He declared his readiness to die, and departed on the 11th of the eleventh month, 1680,
aged about fifty-six years.

His excellent character and the high esteem in which he was held by his friends,
is further portrayed by George Whitehead,
in his _Testimony Concerning that Faithful Man of God, and Servant of Jesus Christ,
Giles Barnardiston._

Worthy is the memorial of the righteous to be recorded,
and the upright to be had in everlasting remembrance.
Such ought to be regarded in their day for their virtue and brightness,
and are worthy to be commemorated when they are gone,
as examples and monuments of God`'s great kindness to men,
that they may be stirred up to seek him and follow their footsteps,
who have walked in the way of life and salvation,
and attained to the end of the perfect man and the upright, which is peace.
My intention herein is to magnify the grace of God,
and to speak of the creature no otherwise, than as his workmanship in Christ Jesus.
All that we can say on behalf of this sincere-hearted man,
comes short of the virtue and excellency with which he was divinely endued.
My soul is overcome in the deep sense of his integrity,
and the remembrance of the sweet society we have often had together,
since the Lord brought him into a living sense of his goodness.
He was a man that feared God and eschewed evil; he hated every evil way.
He sincerely loved God`'s faithful servants and messengers;
he had the true qualifications of an elder and overseer in Christ`'s church,
being blameless in his conduct, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate,
and he truly desired the prosperity of God`'s whole heritage, church and people,
in true love, peace and concord; his heart was set aright,
and his spirit was steadfast with God.
My soul was deeply affected with his innocent life, sincere and tender spirit to God,
and with his humble example among his people, in word, in conduct, in charity, in spirit,
in faith, in purity, in gravity, and sound speech that could not be condemned;
having a clear evangelical testimony, which none but good men are fit to partake of,
and that through the experience of the power and work of Christ Jesus in them.

He valued the sense of that divine life, which he received in Christ Jesus our Lord.
His eye was to that life above all,
and he truly sought and loved unity and peace therein among God`'s people,
and rejoiced where he felt true and living unity,
and beheld good order and steadfastness of faith in Christ and love among them,
that Friends therein might be a strength and comfort to one another in the Lord.
He is taken away from the evil to come; he is entered into his rest and peace,
his reward of glory and triumph is with him; his portion is with the spirits of just men;
as he loved the appearance and life of our Lord Jesus Christ, a crown of righteousness,
life and glory, which was laid up for him, was his portion.
Oh! let his innocent, faithful example and testimony, be remembered,
and have a living impression upon all his friends, relations and acquaintance,
to engage them the more to follow the footsteps of the Lord`'s flock in truth and righteousness,
even in the way and teachings of the grace and counsel of God,
that they may be received into glory hereafter.

=== A Narrative of the Sufferings of John Philly and William Moore, In Hungary and Austria

Among the many remarkable instances of patient adherence to the principles of Truth,
under severe suffering and persecution,
which are furnished by the history of our religious Society,
there are few that exhibit more fully the constancy of the sufferers
or the mighty power of the Lord in sustaining them,
than the cases of William Moore and John Philly.
Of these individuals but little account is preserved,
and we have now no means of ascertaining their birth-place, parentage,
or the manner of their convincement.
John Philly appears to have been an inhabitant of Dover,
where he suffered distraint in the year 1660, for not paying tithes,
and in 1670 was committed to prison there for teaching
school without a license from the bishop;
and being brought before the justices, they tendered the oath of Allegiance to him,
and on his refusing to violate the command of our blessed Saviour,
"`Swear not at all,`" recommitted him.

William Moore seems to have dwelt in Gloucestershire, for in 1683,
he with a number of other Friends,
was committed to prison on an indictment for a month`'s absence from the national worship,
and in 1686 with fifty-five of his fellow-sufferers,
was discharged at the Quarter Sessions,
by virtue of the proclamation of King James the Second.

It does not seem probable, however,
that William was a prisoner there during all that time,
for we find his name in a list of persons who were tried at Guildhall, in London,
on the 8th of tenth month, 1684, on the charge of being present at a riotous assembly,
with force and arms, in White Hart Court;
and although the witnesses brought to convict them,
testified that they were in Angel Court, and not White Hart Court, yet the recorder said,
if they were anywhere in the same ward, it was sufficient ground to find them guilty.
The riotous assembly alluded to, was a meeting for Divine worship,
peaceably held in the street,
the Friends who were at it being stopped there by their
persecutors and prevented from going to their meetinghouse.

William Moore and John Philly appear to have been ministers of the Gospel,
and travelled abroad in the exercise of their gifts.
In the first month, 1662, being in Germany,
with several other Friends engaged in the like service,
they were drawn under a sense of religious duty to proceed into Hungary,
to visit a society known by the name of the Hortesche Brethren.
These people were a kind of Baptists, whose minds had been measurably enlightened,
so as to see the inconsistency of war, oaths, etc., with the Christian religion,
and they consequently refused to swear or fight.
They had their goods and possessions in common,
and lived in families of several hundreds together.

To encounter the perils of such a journey, among a people of a strange language,
of habits and manners widely different from their own, and professing another religion,
in the exercise of which they were known to be intolerant,
was an undertaking attended with so many discouragements,
that nothing short of a clear conviction of its being a Divine requisition,
and a firm trust in the protecting care of an omnipresent Providence,
could have supported them under the prospect.
After being refreshed with the overflowings of the love
of God under the baptizing ministry of William Caton,
they took leave of their brethren in Germany and
set out on their journey the 29th of the first month,
1662.

The information they obtained respecting the settlements,
and the best route to be taken to reach it,
as well as further directions as they passed along,
enabled them to make a pretty direct course,
and through Divine favour they reached Cushart,
a village about a days journey from Presburg, the capital of Lower Hungary,
on the 16th of second month.
Some of the people they wished to see, resided at this place,
by whom they were kindly entertained and had some religious service among them,
also distributed some books,
illustrative of those spiritual views of the Gospel dispensation,
which the Society of Friends hold.

On the following day William went alone to visit another family of the Brethren,
and on the way experienced a remarkable preservation from a wicked man,
who seemed disposed to lay violent hands on him, or to knock him in the head,
in order to obtain his money;
but the Lord restrained him so that he was not permitted to do him any harm.
The Brethren wondered at his preservation,
saying they could not go so far as the next village, without being in great danger.

After having had considerable service in preaching to these communities,
and endeavouring to promote their growth in the life and power of the Christian religion,
they procured the names and ascertained the situations of some more of their families,
one of which was distant about three hundred miles, at a town called Pattuck,
in Upper Hungary.
The Brethren endeavoured to dissuade them from attempting so long and perilous a journey,
and wished them to be contented with visiting such of their
establishments as were situated in the vicinity of Cushart.
With this proposal William appeared to be satisfied,
but John Philly being pressed in spirit to proceed to the more distant settlements,
and not being acquainted with the Dutch language, which William was,
the latter was not easy to leave him, and they accordingly set out together.

Returning to Presburg they pursued their journey towards Comorra,
and finding a boat laden with meal going to the garrison at New Hausell,
which was in the road to Pattuck, they joined the crew;
and when they came near the place,
the boatmen asked them if they had any acquaintance there,
and whether they had a pass--to both which they replied in the negative.
On hearing this, the boatmen told them it would be dangerous to proceed further,
as the people were very suspicious of strangers, and either they or the Turks,
to whom the country was tributary, would be likely to put them to death.
They also informed them that the people at the garrison
of New Hausell were no less cruel and severe,
and had put to death some strangers whom they found
without licenses on the tributary ground.
This was very discouraging and no doubt brought our
friends under very close exercise of mind,
to know what was best to be done.
John Philly being still desirous of going to the village, which was near,
they concluded to proceed; but the boatmen remarked, "`He will not take our counsel now,
but you will remember it and repent when you cannot help it.`"
These words had considerable effect on the mind of William Moore,
who a night or two before had been warned in a dream of
those things which soon after befell them at Comorra.

On reaching this place, they were directed to the house of a Hungarian to lodge,
but could not understand his language, and the desire to converse being mutual,
they sent for a student from the college, with whom William conversed in Latin.
He inquired where they came from and where they were going:
and then entered into a discourse on religious subjects.
On parting, he appeared friendly, and said he wished them well,
though there was a wide difference in their sentiments.

The next day they endeavoured to get across the river,
and made signs to a countryman to take them over in a boat, offering him money.
He accordingly began to make ready, but a Dutch woman coming up, called out,
"`What are you about?
The governor will cause that man to be hanged directly, if he ferries you over.`"
This put a stop to their proceeding;
they gave it up for the present and returned to their lodgings.
On the following day William crossed the water on the south side of the town;
having heard there were many Dutch people and soldiers there,
he hoped to find some with whom he could converse,
and to whom he might distribute some of the religious books he had brought with him,
and which he would gladly have found an opportunity to send to Pattuck.
Coming up with some soldiers, he inquired of them after the country people,
but could not meet with any.
He then asked leave of the guard to walk out into the fields,
where he met with a sentinel, had some discourse with him,
and passed on to where some people were ploughing.
As he returned to the town he was met by three soldiers, and having a book in his hand,
showing the reasons why Friends disowned the ministry of the hireling priests,
one of the soldiers, who belonged to a company commanded by Captain Fusch,
looked at the title of it,
and then spoke of some place in Turkey as being a desirable residence.--William replied,
that he should return from where he came, intending to go back to his companion,
who had remained on the other side of the river.
While waiting at the river for a passage, the soldier above alluded to,
came to him and said he must go before Captain Fusch, where he was accordingly taken.

The captain demanded the book, and looking at the title, asked if he was a Quaker,
to which William, nothing daunted, replied in the affirmative.
This enraged the captain, who exclaimed,
"`These rogues show no respect`"--calling William "`a young Huss,
who had come forth to seduce the people and make uproars.`"
He then caused the soldiers to strip him of his clothes and search him for letters,
papers, etc., and took away his money.
William meekly remonstrated with them, saying they would not like to be done so by;
the captain replied, "`When you get clear you shall have your money,
but I do not think that will be the case.`"
He was then sent to the guard-house,
and in a little while brought before the captain
and searched again more strictly than before,
when some papers were found between the lining of his clothes.
After this examination he was remanded to the guard-house,
and iron shackles and a chain put upon his hands and feet,
and the officers endeavoured to terrify him by threatening
that he should be roasted alive on a wooden spit,
a punishment which had recently been inflicted on some who had travelled without a license.

Far from friends and his country, in the hands of merciless men,
whose occupation familiarized them to injustice and cruelty,
destitute of any human being who could plead his cause or afford him protection,
his situation would have been forlorn indeed,
had he not been enabled to cast himself upon the
goodness and care of that God whom he loved and served,
and who is able to deliver his servants out of every danger.
Conscious that he had committed no crime,
that his being there was in obedience to the Divine will,
and that his only aim had been to spread the Gospel of Jesus
Christ and to promote the everlasting welfare of his fellow-men,
he was enabled to stay his mind upon the Lord, in humble resignation to his holy will.

Word was soon conveyed to the chief officer of the
garrison that such a prisoner was taken,
and shortly after, two soldiers carrying burning matches,
were dispatched to bring him before him.
Expecting little less than immediate death,
his thoughts naturally turned toward his beloved fellow-labourer in this perilous journey,
and he told some of the soldiers that he had a companion
at the inn on the other side of the river,
who would wonder what had become of him if he did not hear from him.
This information soon led to the arrest of John Philly,
although he was innocent of the crime alleged against William,
of coming into the garrison without a license.
They were committed to separate prisons, William to the stock-house,
and John to a room called the Hungarian`'s vault,
appropriated to the inhuman purposes of examining prisoners by torture,
and of private executions, there being a rack, stocks, and a gallows in it.

When William was brought before the commanding officer,
he evinced a disposition even more fierce and barbarous than Captain Fusch,
calling him a rogue, and saying,
"`If I had the power I would at once drown you in that water.`"
Their portmanteau falling into his hands, he gave it to the marshal,
who took from it what he liked, including their Bible and papers,
and then handed it over to another subaltern,
who pretended to be much troubled that they had no
food--and finding no money in their portmanteau,
asked William if John had not some in his possession.
This he could not deny,
on which the man demanded some of John with a threat if he did not comply.
John gave him a ducat, (worth, if silver, one dollar, if gold,
two dollars) which the man got changed and brought to him, asking for some of it,
which he promised to account for to them.
Expecting that they would search him for more and take it away,
and aware that if liberated they should have need of some to defray their expenses home,
he contrived to conceal some from them.

The people among whom they had fallen were Roman Catholics,
and the next day after John Philly was apprehended,
these innocent sufferers were brought before the Inquisitor to be examined.
He inquired where they came from--where they were going--their ages--who sent
them out--what money they had taken up--who had spoken to them at their lodgings,
and many other questions.
John was searched, and what money he had remaining about him, was found.
William was particularly examined about the books,
and informed that he had committed a capital crime,
and that it would cost him his life--he replied, that what he had done therein,
was in simplicity.

After this examination Captain Fusch had William brought before
him and asked him several questions respecting the books,
and who was the first bringer up of these doctrines.
William told him that George Fox was the first who preached
it in these latter days--the captain seemed very bitter,
asking many cunning questions in order to ensnare him,
and said he should cause all the books and papers
to be copied and sent to the prince at Mentz,
and when he could spare them, the Inquisitor should have them.
He was afterward examined by the deputy governor, a cruel old man,
who said he had done worse than if he had killed a hundred men,
and that he would send him with a message to the Devil.
William appearing before him with his hat on, he pronounced it a Turkish practice,
as well as some other of William`'s conscientious conduct.
The governor sent for the student who conversed with our friends at Comorra,
and commanded him to tell in Latin all that passed between them.--This was taken
down in writing and handed to the Inquisitor to read at a subsequent examination,
but he would not read it openly,
probably lest the sitters by should have heard and owned the truth
of the sentiments advanced by William in that conversation.
It does not appear that the student`'s information furnished any pretext for convicting
them of the charge of coming as spies into the garrison or with treacherous intentions.
They then brought up one of the soldiers whom William
met with soon after crossing the river,
and endeavoured to extort something from him which would criminate William.
This man speaking falsely as to what passed between them, William boldly withstood him,
and said to the Inquisitor,
who was evidently eager to substantiate some accusation
which might furnish a ground for punishment,
"`Beware what you do; for if you should cause my blood to be shed under such a pretence,
it will cry to the Lord for vengeance,
and thereby you may draw down the wrath of God upon yourself and others.`"

The proceedings of the Popish Inquisitorial courts,
have ever been disgraced by the most infamous injustice and diabolical cruelty,
cloaked under a pretended sanctity and a mysterious concealment,
which adds greatly to their terrors and their wickedness.
Their object in this, as in other cases,
appears to have been to conceal from the prisoners
the nature of the evidence against them,
and then by threats and tortures, to extort some accusation from their unhappy victims,
though conscious at the same time that they are innocent.
After hearing the false testimony of the soldier,
William demanded that the other soldiers should be examined,
they also having heard what he said.
After some demur this was acceded to, and one of them was brought,
but William was put out of the room while he was giving in his testimony.
During this interval William`'s mind was under great concern,
lest this man also should testify falsely; and he thought within himself,
"`Surely now if the Lord does not help me,
they may persuade him to speak the same thing as the other has done.`"
When the soldier came out he told him he did not say what the other had,
for he had affirmed what was untrue.--Thus their artifices
against these innocent men were defeated for the present,
and they left without any pretext for the cruelties
which they wished to practice upon them;
for which says William, "`I thanked the Lord.`"

Failing in the wicked attempt to convict them on
the pretence of treasonable entry into the garrison,
the Inquisitor then told William that the books were enough to condemn them if
there was nothing more,--and asked whether he did not know the Catholics had
laws to torment and burn heretics and such as carried books about with them;
to which William warily replied that he should not have expected such things among Christians.
He then opened a book which he pretended contained Popish laws, and read,
or feigned to read, out of it a paragraph,
which said that such persons as carried books and papers should be racked.

About this time the Inquisitor commanded John Philly to be searched again for more gold,
and the officer having nearly stripped him,
John was slow in taking off his remaining shoe and stocking, where he had concealed some,
and the marshal weary of the business and thinking there was none,
bid him put them on again.
Thus what little they had left was saved,
and some days after he found an opportunity to hand it to William in a roll of bread,
while they were standing among the soldiers waiting to be called for examination.
These examinations were often repeated during the first eight days after their arrest,
and many ensnaring questions put to them in order to entrap them,
but through Divine help they were preserved from saying anything
that would answer the purposes of their intolerant persecutors.

One morning the Inquisitor sent for a priest,
and handed him a paper of George Fox`'s on the Apostasy of Christendom--on reading which,
the priest became enraged, and angrily demanded "`How are we (Papists) apostatized,
and how can it be proved?`"
William,
instead of entering into a controversy which might have proved worse than useless,
gently reproved him for his wrath, saying,
"`Friend it becomes not a spiritual man to be so furious, but meek,
peaceable and gentle;`" at which the countenance
of the priest fell and he had little more to say.
The Inquisitor then demanded of William what his
opinion was of what they called the sacrament,
to which he wisely answered, that "`Christ said the flesh profits little.
It is the spirit that quickens.`"
So ignorant of the holy Scriptures was this Inquisitor,
that he seemed quite surprised and at a loss about the words, and turning to the priest,
asked, "`How is that?`"
The priest, but little more knowing than his superior,
studied awhile and then said he remembered there was such a saying.
Much more passed, of which no account has been preserved;
and then the Inquisitor plainly asked William if he would turn Catholic?
To which he made this sensible reply--"`If I should do so for fear or favour of you,
the Lord not requiring it of me, I should not have peace in my conscience,
and the displeasure of the Lord would be more intolerable than yours.
Compelling people does but make them hypocrites, and cannot truly change the heart.`"

Thus were they sifted and tempted from day to day, for a week,
when their persecutors being unable to find anything on which to ground their accusation,
determined to resort to the cruel expedient of the rack,
in the hope of making them accuse themselves.
Of this, William Moore, who appears to have been chiefly under examination,
and the principal sufferer, gives the following narrative;--

[quote]
____

Notwithstanding our innocence, the governor would have us racked,
which from the relation I had heard of it, seemed a cruel torture;
and in those days I often poured forth my supplications to the Lord with tears.
On the eighth day they made ready benches to sit on,
lighted the candle and put John out of his room, and sent for me,
the Inquisitor sitting there with two other officers, and the marshal and hangman.

The Inquisitor began by saying, "`William,
that you may not think we deal with you as tyrants,
we will now lay the matter before you, that you may tell what you know in time,
for if you be racked you will be but a miserable man,
and must have your head cut off besides.`"
I told him, "`I had done no evil that I knew of,
nor had I any such thing in my heart against them.`"
Then he read a few lines, which were to this import, "`We, Leopold, etc., Emperor, etc.,
having been informed that two impeached persons, John Philly and William Moore,
have been found by our frontier garrisons, our desire is that they should be racked,
to know their intent.`"
____

It is more than probable that this pretended order of the
emperor for the torture of these harmless Friends,
was a mere forgery,
got up by the Inquisitor and his abetters to answer
their evil designs--the narrative proceeds;

[quote]
____

The hangman according to order, put an iron screw upon my thumbs and screwed them hard,
and bade me tell out.
Then he slacked it a little and again screwed them harder than before;
but this not answering their purpose, he was commanded to proceed further.
Accordingly he tied a small cord about my wrists behind my back,
and another cord around my ankles with a block of wood between my feet.
Then he drew me up on the ladder and tied my hands to it,
and then forced my body quite from the ladder.
At the first pull my left arm was put out of joint with a loud crack,
being tied up shorter than the other; and the executioner was ordered to put it in again.
He accordingly slacked the cords, and then they proceeded to question me,
having three things especially to ask.
First,
Why I asked the student if one should come and say he intended to buy something of them,
would they kill him?
Second: Why we had desired to be set over the water at the town,
and who was the author of it?
Third: Why I had written down some of the names of the garrisons and other places,
notwithstanding I had them in the maps?

The Inquisitor would also force me to tell whether John Philly was an engineer,
a gunner or a minister.
This suspicion of his being a minister was put into their heads
by an Irishman who acted as interpreter between me and them,
and who had an implacable hatred to Englishmen, and especially to ministers,
as I afterwards plainly understood from his own mouth.
I answered, and kept to it, that he was a husbandman and a maltman,
and that I knew him not until he came to Amsterdam.
The Inquisitor then asked me if I had a mind to go to the Turks and become one of them?
I said I had rather die than be one.

In the mean time my body was so racked, that my chin was close to my breast,
and my mouth so closed that I was almost choked and could not well speak,
and I should not wish anyone to experience the painful torture I endured;
and when the cords were slacked my sufferings were
almost as great as when they pulled them.
Yet still they would be questioning me,
so that I asked them where was their Christian love, and whether they were doing to me,
as they would wish to be done unto.
The doors being shut and guarded,
I spoke and cried aloud in order that the people might hear,
and bear witness what they were doing to me.
They seemed determined to force something out of me,
and I told them that by such means they might compel persons to say more than they knew,
as I believed many had done, in order to be out of their pain.
I had rather they had beheaded me at once, as they threatened to do,
than to torture me in the manner they did--but they would not do that then,
for the Inquisitor would have me to confess myself guilty,
which I suppose would have satisfied them,
even though they had known I confessed to a lie.
At length I told them it was for the love of our religion, that we came to these places;
and then they left off, thinking this was crime enough,
though the Inquisitor threatened that I should be racked again on the third day.

They then brought in John Philly,
who not seeing me and having heard me cry out a little before,
supposed I had been hanged on the private gallows and put out of the way.
But he was resigned and steadfast, being confident in the Lord,
who had sealed it upon his mind, before he came forth,
that he should have his life for a prey.
They put four questions to him to answer,
and his thumbs were screwed and he was twice drawn upon the ladder, when he cried out,
"`Innocent.`"
They asked the interpreter what that was; and when he told them,
they were smitten in their consciences and left off.
Probably they gave over tormenting John the sooner,
because if there had been any evil design in us they
would have been more likely to get it out of me,
whom they appeared to take more pleasure in torturing,
as they could understand me and I them.

When they had got through with all this, and could find no contradiction in what we said,
they invented a falsehood, and the marshal came to me and said,
John had told him I had no money of my own, but what I had was his,
and then bade me tell him how it was.
I knew this to be false, and that they did but seek some occasion against us,
but we kept to the truth and their expectation failed them.
They then told me that there would be twenty or thirty men of note,
out of the neighbouring quarters, appointed to hold a court of justice upon us,
and to determine what deaths we should die.
In the mean time the Inquisitor came and desired
me first to write some of the heads of my religion,
which I did, and he raged very much at some of them.
____

John Philly being much impressed with a sense of
the wickedness of the Inquisitor and priests,
and how they were plotting to take away their lives,
was desirous to bring their case before the governor, and seeing him pass in his coach,
he cried out to him, on which the governor sent to know what he would have.
John acquainted him with the questions which had been put to them when they were racked,
and also with their answers, in which he told him no contradiction or untruth was found.
He afterward obtained pen and ink and wrote to him more fully on the subject,
for he strongly suspected, and not without good ground,
that the Inquisitors and priests had perverted their answers.
Conscious of his evil deeds towards these harmless men,
the Inquisitor got possession of the letter to the governor and sought to conceal it;
but John having another opportunity of conversing with the governor informed him thereof,
and he directed that the letter should be given to William Moore to translate for him,
which was done.

Not long after this,
the Inquisitor informed them they might go out and work at throwing earth into a wheelbarrow,
by which they could earn nearly two-pence a day to buy bread--observing,
that the balance of their money which remained in his hands
was but little to pay for the pains he had been at,
and that the marshal and executioner must have some for their trouble.
Our friends willingly accepted the offer of work thus made them,
both for the sake of fresh air and exercise,
and in the hope that their sufferings being thus brought to the notice of the people,
might move some to compassion, and thus prepare the way for their enlargement.
Comorra contained a considerable number of Lutherans
and Calvinists who commiserated their condition,
but who dared not to converse with them or visit them in the castle.
Sometimes the marshal would not allow them to go out,
and at others he would keep back their wages, and on those called saints-days,
they got no work,
so that their allowance of food would have been small had not some kindly disposed women,
whose hearts the Lord moved with pity toward them, supplied their necessities.

During nearly all the time since their arrest, William and John had been kept apart,
which was a great addition to their affliction,
depriving them of that mutual support and sympathy,
which fellow-sufferers in a Christian cause,
derive from the company and converse of each other.
They now however obtained permission to be together;
and had fresh evidence that that gracious and merciful Being,
whom they were endeavouring to honour and serve, was watching over and caring for them.

They both wrote again to the governor, acknowledging his moderation toward them,
in refusing to comply with the cruel desires of their enemies,
and laying their case before him.
The Inquisitor intercepted these letters also,
but the governor coming to the knowledge of it, obliged him to give them up,
and their chains were soon after taken off.

After some time several officers of the government came to view the garrison,
and William and John were summoned before them.
On their way,
the marshal threatened them with hanging on a new gallows which had been that day erected;
and at the table sat a priest who manifested great enmity to them,
saying they had forfeited their lives.
William told him "`they thirsted for their blood, and the officers hearkened to them,
but as for him and his companion they had none but God to plead for them.`"
The priest put many sophistical arguments to William, evidently designed to ensnare him;
but some of the others wishing to converse with him,
he was enabled to speak the truth to them with much boldness.

In one of the letters which John Philly wrote to the governor,
after stating their case and the hardships they underwent,
he made some allusion to appealing to the higher power;
and after they had been prisoners about sixteen weeks,
the governor said he should send them there accordingly.
Iron bolts were put on their feet,
and under a guard of four soldiers they were conveyed in a wagon to Vienna,
and delivered to Lord Francis, of Nadasti,
privy counsellor and lord chamberlain to the emperor.

On the following morning they were brought before
him and several other lords of the empire,
by whom they were examined respecting their religion and other matters;
and although some of them, particularly the secretary,
appeared to be affected by their answers, and none made any objection,
yet they passed sentence that they should be burned,
if they would not embrace the Roman Catholic religion,
their law tolerating only that and the Lutheran and Calvinistic,
and enacting that whoever brought any new religion there should be burned.
Under this cruel sentence John`'s mind was divinely supported,
and he encouraged his companion,
telling him the power of the Lord would divide their council,
which they were afterwards told was the case,
by an Irish priest who appeared to be kindly disposed toward them.
He was sent to procure from them a written account of their religion,
which they accordingly drew up in English and gave to him,
and William afterward translated it and put it into Nadasti`'s hands.
Soon after this a priest was sent to console them,
who read to them out of the catechism and questioned them concerning the creed,
sacraments, mass, etc.,
but their threats and endeavours being alike ineffectual to shake the
constancy of these Friends or induce them to abandon their religion,
they were sent to a place five miles from Vienna,
where they fell into the power of some priests who were
very cruel to them and their lives were in great peril.
They caused them to be again searched and their books and papers taken away,
and imprisoned them in a small hole where were some
Turks who were ironed and in the stocks.

The next day they took them to what they called their churches and endeavoured
to compel them to take off their hats to their images,
and when they could not prevail, they put iron shackles on their hands,
which were so small that when the lock was forced in,
they occasioned such extreme pain that our friends could not refrain from crying out,
at which they appeared pleased.
Then they threatened to carry into execution the inhuman
sentence which had been so unjustly pronounced upon them,
and told of several instruments of cruelty by which they tortured persons,
and that they could give them a taste of their strong arguments for converting heretics,
such as putting hot brass or copper plates upon their breasts,
burning them under their arms, etc.
Through the goodness of the Lord who was their present help and comforter,
these constant sufferers were enabled to hold fast
the profession of their faith without wavering,
and to avoid being ensnared by their artifices or shaken by their threats.

Having nothing but the floor to lie upon,
in the narrow dungeon to which they were confined,
William desired one of the priests to use them more like men or Christians,
and give them some straw to lie on, for they were worse off than the Turks;
but the only reply he got was,
that they considered them worse than the Turks;--and about the same time they
pressed them very much to take some drink which they had prepared for them,
but suspecting it to be poisoned, they would not partake of it,
on which one of the priests said in Latin, "`it is suspected.`"

But though they could procure nothing to lie upon, yet William says,
"`Blessed be the name of the Lord,
we slept well in our shackles upon the besoms in the corner; yes,
better than could be expected, though my wristband pained me much.
The priests and others sought much to discourage us;
and as I was one day sitting upon a bench, musing on our situation, and thinking,
'`Lord help us--what will be the end of all this--will they have power to murder us here,
where few may know of it, there being no other sects to be witnesses,
as there were at Comorra;`' my mind was turned inward,
and on a sudden it was as if I saw a man clothed in white, sitting on a white horse,
riding in haste toward me, as if to rescue me.
This comforted me, believing it was from the Lord to encourage me,
lest I should be too much cast down.
On the same day a message came from the earl,
signifying his displeasure with the proceedings against us.`"

Who this earl was, or what office he held in the government,
does not appear from any of the records respecting these Friends, but the probability is,
that he was a person exercising the highest civil authority in the place.
The manner in which he became particularly interested on behalf of our friends,
is a striking proof, how Divine Providence is often pleased to raise up instruments,
even from those who seem most unlikely to aid in
his gracious designs on behalf of his servants,
and furnishes additional inducement to trust in the Lord,
even under the most unpropitious and discouraging circumstances.

Adam Bien, who acted as barber to the earl,
had been educated among the Hortesche Brethren,
and being favoured in his early years with some degree of Divine illumination,
his understanding was opened to see the nature of true religion,
and the lifelessness and inefficacy of the formal acts of these people,
against which he bore a testimony.
It would appear,
that though he had not faithfully lived up to the
views with which he had been thus favoured,
yet there was still some remains of his former good feelings--and
the earl having put into his hands some of the papers written
by our friends and given him an account of them,
his former religious impressions revived,
and the Divine witness in his heart bore testimony that their religion was the truth.

An earnest desire was now awakened in his mind to see and converse with these prisoners,
and through his influence with the earl, this was readily obtained.
Through the means of their discourse and his interview with them,
he became more fully reached and convinced of the verity of the doctrines they held,
and he continued throughout the period of their stay there,
their steadfast and useful friend.
He told them that the earl was of the opinion the priests must
have been intoxicated when they treated them with so much cruelty,
"`which was true,`" says the narrative, "`for they were drunk both with rage and wine.`"

The friendly interference of the earl, and his reproof of their persecutors,
had the effect to check the torrent of abuse and cruelty which threatened
to bear down and destroy our friends--the current seemed to change,
and some who had distinguished themselves by promoting
the violent and malicious proceedings against them,
now seemed disposed to ingratiate themselves with them,
and to obliterate the remembrance of their past misconduct, by kindness and flattery.
The priests and other officers also,
were restrained from confining them in their narrow dungeon,
and inflicting on them the acts of barbarity which they had been accustomed to do,
which was no small mortification to them.

There seemed now a reasonable prospect that they might soon obtain their liberty.
At the request of the officers they had procured from Friends in Holland,
certificates of their character,
and also the king`'s proclamation for setting their friends at home at liberty,
which produced a favourable effect;
but a malicious priest used great exertions to prevent their liberation,
by infusing prejudices into the earl`'s mind,
and endeavouring to give him a bad opinion of them.
Soon after this the earl was taken seriously ill at Vienna,
which for the present disappointed John and William in their hopes of liberty.

The temper and spirit infused by the religion of
these ecclesiastics showed itself in various ways,
not to be the product of the wisdom which is from above, but of that which "`is earthly,
sensual and devilish.`"
An Englishman from Vienna, who was called a spiritual lord,
asked them if they had come to plant their religion in that country, adding,
"`Sects have occasioned much mischief in England, but now they will be rooted out.`"
John Philly replied, that the love of God could reconcile them;
to which the other rejoined by profanely wishing evil to that love,
with other wicked expressions, very unbecoming the character of a Christian professor,
and proving that he was not only carnal but profane.

At another time, a priest called brother Valentine,
came to them and conversed about the Bible,
in the course of which he asserted that "`it had brought many thousands into hell.`"
Then he read a paper which John had written to the earl and council,
setting forth that they were Englishmen,
and as there was no discord between England and Austria,
he knew not why an Englishman coming into any of the emperor`'s
dominions to visit the people and spend his money,
should be so cruelly used, etc., to which Valentine replied,
that "`they ought to be beheaded, for if that course had been taken with Luther,
there had not been so many Lutherans and heretics now.`"
He called Friends the forerunners of antichrist,
and the report got widely circulated that antichrist
was taken prisoner and was at Nadasti`'s court.
This man`'s virulent and bitter spirit, no less than the gross profanity of the other,
discovers a temper far removed from the benign spirit of the Gospel, which is pure,
peaceable, gentle and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and of good fruits,
and desires the present happiness and everlasting welfare of all.
They took a very absurd method to recommend their religion to the minds of the prisoners,
who understood the nature of Christianity too well not to
perceive that a profession which tolerated such practices,
had no valid claim to that sacred appellation; and that although ambition,
pride and priestcraft might resort to compulsory methods to carry their purposes,
yet the religion of the Gospel abhorred them as destructive of its very essence.

So effectually had the exemplary conduct of the prisoners,
as well as the truths they declared, wrought upon the mind of Adam Bien,
that without their knowledge,
he had solicited the earl for liberty to take them to his house, and keep them there,
the winter being cold and their place of confinement a guard-house,
the doors of which stood open all day and much of the night,--offering
his own person as security for them if they should run away.
Here is a striking evidence that a faithful and upright
walking in conformity with our religious principles,
raises in the minds of beholders a testimony in our behalf,
and inspires them with a confidence and affection, which nothing else could produce.

But though Adam succeeded in obtaining the earl`'s consent to the proposed change,
our friends were not willing to add the burden of their support
to the many obligations under which his kindness already laid them;
but chose rather to content themselves where they were;
yet they got permission to visit at his house occasionally,
and were often refreshed together in a sense of the love of God to their souls,
as well as the nearness of affection and Christian
fellowship which they felt for each other,
and for their dear friends at home.
At his house they sometimes had opportunities of preaching
the Truth to the Hortesche Brethren who came there,
warning them of the desolation which would come upon the unfaithful;
a prediction which was fulfilled even as to the outward, as regarded many of them,
for of nine families or communities, eight were destroyed,
upwards of two hundred men slain and taken captive,
and a large amount of property was consumed by fire.

But though the sufferings of our friends were somewhat mitigated,
they were not yet at an end.
Both the priests and soldiers, appeared to be afraid of Adam Bien,
who stood over them in his integrity and uprightness, and whose daily access to,
and intimacy with the earl, gave him many opportunities of influencing his mind;
yet they secretly contrived to be vexatious to the Friends,
and in various ways sought to ensnare them and add to their afflictions.
By their treacherous insinuations,
they seem at length to have obtained their ends so
far as to induce the earl to wink at a plot,
which was laid for separating the prisoners, and carrying William away by stealth.
Jealous of everything which was likely to diminish their importance and authority,
or to prejudice their corrupt religion,
the priests probably selected William as their victim,
because he had a knowledge of the Dutch and Latin languages,
and was therefore more likely to spread a knowledge of the principles of Friends.

In order to accomplish this design, a person selected for the purpose,
came to William and gave him two glass vessels,
under pretense of getting him to assist in carrying some wine,
and thus succeeded in drawing him out of the town into the fields.
Here they were met by several sleds,
the country being so deeply covered with snow that
wagons could not travel;--and on their coming up,
the man, who had armed himself with a great cudgel,
compelled William to lay down the glass vessels and get on one of the sleds.
Sensible that some mischief was intended him,
and fearful lest they might wreak their vengeance upon Adam and John,
under pretense that he had run away,
William resolved to try to extricate himself and return to the city.
In this attempt he was defeated; for a soldier,
whom William knew to be a wicked and desperate fellow, and who had before threatened him,
having joined his betrayer, they seized him by the hair,
beat him until they shed much of his blood and had almost struck out one of his eyes,
then threw him down in the snow, tied his hands and feet,
and bound him on the sled with his face down to the hay, and carried him off.

At first he suspected they intended to murder him privately in an adjoining wood,
and afterward when they came near a gallows, he thought they designed to hang him there,
but they passed by both; and meeting some people in the road,
they muffled him in a cloak, and one of them sat upon him that he might not be seen.
Hearing the noise of their feet in the snow as they approached,
and being very anxious to convey to Adam Bien and his companion
some intelligence of the manner of his being carried away,
William called out to the people and desired them to tell Adam that he was there,
and had been forcibly carried off--but the soldier beat him severely for it.
When they came to the lodging place, they put irons on his ankles,
and a long iron chain about his neck, the other end of which they fastened over a beam.
Next morning they passed through a village where he would gladly have spoken to someone,
but they forced him to lie down until they got through it,
and conveyed him to a cloister.
The prior being absent from home, the monks would not receive him without his order,
and he was again compelled to lie in irons as he had done the night before.
On the following morning he was taken to the cloister or castle,
and his conductor gave directions that he should
be blindfolded and put into a deep dungeon,
and have only a little bread and water,
and that none should be permitted to give any intelligence respecting him;
and a Jew being there,
he was forbidden on pain of death to say anything of what he had seen.
William was accordingly put into a small hole, to which no light was admitted,
and there they kept him four days and nights in cold frosty weather,
so that it seemed wonderful he had not perished.

The clandestine manner in which he had been taken away,
and the mysterious secrecy which his enemies were so anxious to preserve,
would naturally lead him to suspect that their design was either to dispatch him privately,
or to bury him alive in a dungeon, until death should release him,
or solitude and suffering shake his constancy and induce him to embrace their religion.
But through the merciful interposition,
as well as the supporting power of Divine Providence,
he was preserved under all his trials,
in unshaken confidence in the rectitude of those
religious principles for which he was so deep a sufferer.

After twelve days`' confinement,
the prior returned home and sent for William to appear before him.
He questioned him concerning their object in coming into that country,
and on some points of their religion,
to all which he returned such replies as were consistent with truth and soberness.
The prior told him,
what they owned was not enough,--they must believe the pope was Christ`'s vicar,
and that he and the priests had power to bind and loose on earth and in heaven.
After they had reasoned together awhile, the prior sent him back into confinement,
telling him he would come and talk with him again and bring the Bible;
but he rather seemed to avoid him.
Once however he discoursed with him again,
in the course of which William boldly bore his testimony against their covetousness,
pride, persecution, and warlike weapons,
all which were contrary to the example of Christ and his apostles;
and was helped to deliver himself so clearly,
that the prior afterward acknowledged he had never
before conversed with anyone who gave such answers.

His demeanour being watchful and circumspect,
consistent with the purity of the religious principles he avowed,
they were the more anxious to induce him to embrace the Romish religion,
and sent a priest to instruct and convert him--offering him preferment and other advantages.
But none of these means succeeding, they then threatened to cut out his tongue,
to flay him alive, or to burn him if he would not turn.
But his constancy was not to be shaken,
either by the hope of gain or the fear of torture and death,
and relying on that God who had preserved him hitherto, and who, he firmly believed,
would support him to the end,
he persisted in the faithful maintenance of his religious principles.
In order to try if they could terrify him into compliance,
they put him into a tub--passed a rope through the ears of it and over a beam,
and said he should be let down into a well which was more than thirty fathoms deep.
They did not however do this,
but drew him up over the beam and let him fall out--then raising him up again,
they twisted the rope and let it go, so as to whirl him violently about.
He silently bore their insults and abuse, appearing to be little moved at them,
which occasioned his persecutors to marvel, being ignorant of the power of that grace,
which enables its obedient subjects to rejoice that they
are counted worthy to suffer for the name of Christ Jesus.
They then took him to another place, locked his neck and feet close together,
and spread out his hands and locked them in that position;
some asking him if it was painful, and others saying they committed more sin by doing so,
than they got profit.

At another time they put him into a wheel, and caused some soldiers to turn it,
so that he might be thrown from side to side, which might have done him much injury,
but he held fast by the side of it,
which prevented their mischief--yet one of his elbows was much bruised.

During all this period, Adam Bien continued their firm and steady friend,
anxious to do whatever he could for their relief.
The earl insinuated to him that William had run away,
but Adam had too much confidence in the integrity
of his friend to give credit to such a story.
At length,
by some means he received intelligence of the manner and place of William`'s confinement,
on which he wrote him a letter and sent it by an officer of the castle,
who maliciously refused to let him have it.
He however got sight of it after awhile,
and learned from it that the plot for his removal was kept so secret,
that only three persons had a knowledge of it,
and that his kind and sympathizing friend Adam,
greatly desired an opportunity to forward to him some necessaries
and comforts to render his situation more tolerable.
This he soon found means to do;
and also gave an order that William should be furnished
with an ample allowance of bread at his expense.

Soon after this the earl was seized with an illness,
from which his recovery was doubtful, and being apparently near unto death,
Adam obtained from him a promise to set the prisoners at liberty.
When the order for William`'s discharge arrived, instead of releasing him immediately,
they detained him six weeks to assist the masons who were building them a new cloister,
promising that if he was diligent they would tell him good news,
on the return of the officer in whose custody he was.
Accordingly, he took him aside and told him the earl would have him informed,
that if he would turn Catholic he should have good service and preferment;
but if he would not, he would detain him no longer,
as he had prisoners enough without him--but it was concluded
that if they were again found in Hungary or Austria,
he and his companion should be burned.

On the 4th of seventh month, 1663, William was set at liberty.
The kindness of his friend Adam Bien, followed him to the last,
for he had written to the prior to furnish him with
money to pay the expenses of his journey;
but he only gave him five small coins, the value of all which was less than twenty cents.
His companion and he having before been stripped of all their money,
which was considerable, he now found himself a stranger, in a remote country,
without money and without friends,
and a long distance to travel before he could reach his native land,
or any of the settlements of his brethren in religious profession.
To add to his difficulties, the country was in a state of warfare,
hostilities having commenced between the Austrians and Turks, and all the towns,
villages and principal passes were guarded by persons
whose duty it was to seize and examine strangers,
of whom they were very suspicious.
Here was a fresh trial of his faith and fortitude;
but resolving to trust in the protecting care of Divine Providence,
he commenced his solitary walk, choosing the most private and unfrequented ways.

He had been advised to go to Gratz, where was a fair,
at which it was probable there would be merchants
from Nuremburg and other places in Germany,
of whom he might have some knowledge, and from whom he might obtain aid.
On reaching the gates of Gratz, he was stopped and not permitted to enter.
"`When I saw,`" says he, "`that I could not meet with the aforesaid merchants,
I resolved to travel on my journey, and to trust the Lord to take care for my sustenance,
who had often done it, when, as to the outward there was little appearance of relief.`"
When he came to the west end of Austria,
he was stopped on pretense that he had been sent by the Turks as a spy;
but producing the certificates he had procured from Friends in Germany,
they let him pass, but charged him not to tarry at their towns.
"`I have great cause,`" continues he, "`to thank the Lord for his goodness,
for I did not much lack food, but got either bread or fruit, or something to eat,
the people in these countries being accustomed to give travellers and tradesmen bread,
and lodging in their barns.
Sometimes I told them how I had been robbed and abused,
and their hearts were moved with pity towards me.
I proceeded on my journey, though not without difficulty,
and about the 2nd of the eighth month, through mercy, I got to Paltz, in Germany,
and came through Heidleburg and Manheim, and on the 7th of the same arrived at Christein,
among Friends, and being kindly entertained and abundantly refreshed there,
I tarried some weeks.`"

By a letter afterwards received from Adam Bien,
it appeared that John Philly was released from his
imprisonment on the 6th of seventh month,
two days after William, and set out for Germany,
but no particulars respecting his journey home have come down to us.

The foregoing narrative exhibits in a remarkable manner the protecting providence of God,
which accompanies and supports those,
who in holy obedience to the commands of his Spirit,
are devoted to answer his requirings.
The many dangers, provocations and trials through which these Friends passed unhurt,
the taunts,
the jeers and tortures with which their persecutors
were permitted to prove their fidelity and patience;
the cruel deaths which threatened them,
demonstrate in the clearest manner the steadfastness of their faith and allegiance,
and the excellency of the religion of which they were in possession.
Their eye and expectation being fixed upon Jesus, the author and finisher of their faith,
who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame,
and is forever set down at the right hand of the throne of God;
and considering him who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself;
they were not weary of suffering, nor did they faint in their minds.
In all their afflictions,
the consciousness of their integrity and the evidence of Divine favour,
were an unfailing source of support--the consolations of
the Spirit of God raised their minds above the fear of man,
and enabled them to persevere in an unwavering confession of their faith,
even before many witnesses; and they were endued with a wisdom from above,
whereby they were not only enabled to detect and expose the subtle
devices and snares of those who sought their destruction,
but were qualified to testify to the Truth as it is in Jesus,
before governors and rulers, and to honour and exalt his ever worthy name.
It was the power of the Lord which thus helped and kept them,
and the praise belongs to Him alone,
who is the preserver of those who put their trust in Him,
whom he still "`delivers out of the hand of the wicked,
and out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.`"

=== Memoir of Gharret Van Hassen

Gharret Van Hassen, an ancient Friend of Dublin, born in Holland, about the year 1695,
was a signal instance of the mercy and long forbearance of a gracious God;
having been favoured with a Divine and powerful visitation,
about the fortieth year of his age,
and thereby reclaimed from a state of unregeneracy and sin, witnessing true repentance.
He joined in society with Friends,
and his relation of this event may be given in his own words,
the reader making allowance for the language, learned late in life:

[quote]
____

It came to pass in the fortieth year of my age, that I left Holland, and came to England,
in order to take shipping at London for Philadelphia, there to settle.
The week I intended to set out, I was taken with the gout, which I had never had;
and before I was recovered, the ship went out, and left me behind.
Within two weeks after, it was in the newspapers that this same ship was lost,
and all that were in it.
Oh! that such a deliverance may be as a seal upon my mind.
From London I removed to Colchester and there settled, working at my trade,
which was wool-combing.
I joined with a Dutch Society, which was in this place,
where the minister preached in my own language.
And it came to pass, one day, after our Society broke up,
in the way towards my lodging I came near the meetinghouse of the people called Quakers;
and seeing people standing in the yard with their hats off,
I went in and stood among them, as near to the door as I well could,
and heard the voice of a woman in prayer; which so affected me, that I wept bitterly,
and in that frame went to my lodging.

The next morning I went to the minister of our Society, and said to him; "`Sir,
something is the cause of my coming to you.`"
He asked me what it was?
Then I said: "`Sir, I never remember to have shed a tear under all your doctrine;
and yesterday I heard a woman, not understanding a word she said,
yet it made such an alarm in the book of my conscience, that if I was to die this night,
I fear I am not fit for God nor his kingdom.
What, Sir, (said I,) can be the meaning of this?`"
To which he replied: "`The woman is a witch, and has bewitched you.`"
Upon this I asked what this people were?
Then he asked me if I had a mind to be a Quaker?
I answered: "`No, God forbid; but before I go to heaven I must be a good Christian.`"
To which he replied: "`Then you must not go among them, for they are not Christians.`"
Then immediately that text of Scripture came before me,
"`Men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.`"
He parted from me in great anger; and the succeeding week,
I went to the Quaker`'s meeting, when a public Friend, called Sarah Lay,
stood up and spoke a few words.
But I could not understand one word, being a stranger to the language;
neither did what she said affect me.
And so I came back out of the meeting, concluding in my mind to go the next week;
but if the woman was not then there whose voice affected me the week before,
I resolved never to go again.
The next week, according to intention, I went again; and in a short time, Mary Wyatt,
then unknown to me, came in, and soon after kneeled down to prayer.
Then, being greatly affected, I cried in secret:
"`What a pity it is that all the world is not of one language!
If so, I should know what this woman says.`"
From henceforward I have continued among Friends, and am now,
at the time of writing this, in the fifty-eighth year of my age;
about eighteen years from the time of my convincement.
____

Being through faithfulness led in the paths of piety and love to God and men,
he became a minister, and was a fervent labourer,
zealous in his testimony against the inordinate love of the world,
affectionately tender to the youth,
and solicitous for their preservation from the temptations
incident to their time of life.

In the year 1737, Gharret Van Hassen came to Ireland;
and for the most part of his remaining time, resided in Dublin.
He visited the meetings of Friends in Great Britain; and in the year 1747,
performed a visit to most, or all the families of Friends in Ireland,
and also to such as had incurred the censure of the Society;
in which labour he was well received, for his heart overflowed with charity.

Simple in his manners, and unassuming; industrious and independent; living alone,
and with great neatness, though in very limited circumstances,
he was respected as well as beloved.
It is related of him, that travelling alone in Scotland,
during the hostilities exercised in 1745, he was stopped by military men, who inquired;
"`What king are you for?`"
The answer to this question was hazardous; but the honest-hearted man replying,
"`I am for the King of heaven,`" he was permitted to proceed unmolested on his way.

During the latter part of his life, he was greatly afflicted with bodily infirmities,
disabling him, in a great measure, for public service:
but he still retained his love to God and man, and at or near the time of his conclusion,
had the comfortable assurance of his approaching removal to a better state; saying,
"`I am going to your Father and my Father; to your God and my God.
I die daily, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me.`"
He departed this life the 30th of sixth month, 1765, aged about seventy;

=== Memoir of Sarah Morris, a Minister of the Gospel in the Religious Society of Friends

She was born in Philadelphia, about the year 1704.
Her parents, Anthony and Elizabeth Morris, being worthy Friends,
were concerned to educate her in the fear of the Lord,
in the diligent attendance of religious meetings,
and in an early acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures;
and she often in after life acknowledged the benefit of their pious care in these respects.
Through the Lord`'s blessing on these means, and the preserving power of Divine grace,
she was kept from many of the follies to which youth is incident; and her father,
when near his end, remarked respecting her, that she had never disobeyed him,
but had been a comfort to him; an example worthy of imitation.

Being endued with a superior understanding and an affable disposition,
her company was much sought by such as were esteemed the wise and great;
but her mind was religiously inclined to prefer the
society of those who exceeded her in age and experience;
and through the merciful regard of her heavenly Father,
she experienced preservation from the levity and
vanity by which many young persons are captivated.

In a short account which she left of her early visitation,
she gratefully acknowledges the advantages she enjoyed
from the pious and watchful concern of her parents,
and adds;

____

But what was far beyond all outward blessings,
the Lord in his mercy was pleased to make very early impressions of religion on my soul,
by his immediate grace and good Spirit,
and made me sensible of the touches of his love when very young;
by which I was in a good degree preserved from the evils of the world, and not only so,
but comforted and supported in every time of difficulty,
as there was a regard to that good hand,
which will ever be the help of all those who trust in it.

It pleased God, by the death of a sister whom I entirely loved,
to give me a fresh instance of the uncertainty and
unsatisfactoriness of all temporal blessings,
and to strengthen my desires after the enjoyment of that which is eternal,
and fades not away; and strong cries were raised in my soul,
that I might be brought to a nearer acquaintance,
and a more constant abiding with the beloved of souls,
who had raised in me such a hunger and thirst after righteousness,
that my soul could not be satisfied short of it.
After it had pleased God thus to incline me to seek
a more full enjoyment of that inward life and virtue,
which is conveyed to the soul through the illumination of the Holy Spirit,
I was visited with sickness, and had so near a prospect of eternity,
that I seemed just entering into it.
O then, the emptiness and vanity of the world,
and all the pleasures and friendships of it, appeared in a clear and strong light:
nothing but the hope of an entrance into the kingdom of heaven seemed of any value,
and that hope the Lord was pleased in some degree to afford me.
Yet I thought I saw a great deficiency in my past conduct, and desired of the Lord,
that if it was his will to restore me,
he would enable me to live more closely attentive to his teachings,
and to follow him more fully than I had hitherto done.

But in order to this,
I saw that a work of greater mortification than I had ever experienced, was necessary.
Great distress of soul and affliction of body was I brought into;
and such temptations and buffetings of Satan, as I had until now been a stranger to,
were permitted to beset me, in the absence of spiritual comfort and refreshment.
But in all this the Lord was very merciful,
and let me see that his dealings with my soul were in order to qualify me for his service.
O then, I was willing to enter into the solemn engagement,
if you Lord will be with me in the way that I go,
and give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, in a spiritual sense,
and bring me to my heavenly Father`'s house in peace.
You shall be my God, and I will serve you.
And the Lord, who knew the tenderness of my heart, for it was his own work,
was graciously pleased to shower down the heavenly rain of his kingdom,
by which my soul was greatly comforted and refreshed,
and in a true sense of my own nothingness and inability
to do anything that was acceptable in his sight,
without his assistance, my spirit was greatly humbled before him,
and a resignation wrought to be given up in all things to Him,
who had thus enabled me to praise his name,
for deliverance from great and sore conflicts and troubles, unknown to any but himself.
Then was the Lord my refuge and hiding place,
and under the shadow of his wing was I kept; and in the sweet enjoyment of divine love,
light and life, was at times made to say,
surely nothing shall ever be able to separate me from the love of God in Christ Jesus.

But alas! this lasted not long;
for when it was clearly shown me what was required at my hand,
which was to bear a public testimony for God,
and to declare unto others what he had done for my soul,
then consultations with flesh and blood began; doubts, fears, and reasonings increased,
so that great darkness and distress came upon me.
I could not now apply with the same confidence and trust as formerly,
to Him who alone can help, but began to disclose something of my condition to others,
from which time I was sensible that my strength decreased.
All this time I was willing to hope that a fresh visitation might, sometime, be afforded,
for without it I saw my state to be very dangerous.
What would I not then have done to recover my former condition?
I went under great distress and perplexity day and night for some months;
the comfortable refreshments and divine openings,
with which I had been so plentifully favoured, were withdrawn,
and I left in unspeakable anguish.
I cried unto the Lord to show me his will, and enable me to perform it;
but the sense of his love was so far withdrawn, and fears and doubts so prevailed,
that I began to question everything;
and by degrees the unwearied adversary has so prevailed, that I am,
according to my weak apprehension, left very much to myself, stripped of inward comfort,
and not able to take pleasure in anything this world can afford.

Through the mercy of the Lord she was preserved under this close probation,
and in his time graciously relieved by the quickening
virtue of his divine presence and power;
and in deep abasement became resigned to his holy requirings.
She was brought forth in the work of the ministry about the forty-second year of her age,
in great mortification to her own will;
and it became evident to the sensible and feeling members of the church,
that she was rightly called and anointed by her Lord and Master for this weighty work.
Abiding in humility and faithfulness to her gift,
she increased in religious depth and experience,
and became an able minister of the gospel, being sound and pertinent in her doctrine,
and careful to adorn it by a pious and exemplary life and conduct.

Her labours in the work of the ministry were chiefly confined to her native city;
yet under the constraining power of divine love,
and the putting forth of the heavenly Shepherd,
she visited many of the meetings of Friends in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, etc.;
and when near seventy years old, she yielded to an apprehension of duty,
which had long rested on her mind,
and paid a religious visit to Friends in Great Britain.
In the ninth month, 1773, she returned from this engagement,
much reduced in her bodily health and strength; but during the following winter,
united with Mary Leaver and Elizabeth Robinson,
(two ministering Friends from England,) in a visit to the families of Friends in Philadelphia,
in which service she was eminently favoured with divine help.

In the fifth month, 1774, she visited Friends of New York and Long island,
and attended the yearly meeting there; and during the summer and fall of that year,
some of the meetings of New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
being favoured with a lively and edifying testimony in most places;
thus evincing a commendable zeal and dedication to the Lord`'s service,
when far advanced in life, and under much bodily infirmity.

She manifested a steady and godly concern for the advancement
of the precious cause of Truth and righteousness,
and the preservation of her fellow members in true Christian fellowship,
not only in the exercise of her gift as a minister, but in her daily walk and conduct,
as well as in meetings for the maintenance of church discipline,
a service for which she was well qualified.

For several months before her death, she was afflicted with the dropsy,
which rendered it difficult for her to go out of her house; yet such was her love to God,
his truth and people, that she made great exertions to get to meeting,
and when unable to walk, was several times carried there.

During her last illness she had to endure great bodily suffering,
and at times depression of spirit, yet was at seasons much favoured,
through the Lord`'s mercy, with the lifting up of the light of his blessed countenance,
and uttered many comfortable and edifying expressions.
It was a time of great civil commotion in the land,
and she one day heard the sound of a drum passing, on which she remarked,
"`The Spirit of Christ is the Christian`'s glory and strength.
It makes us humble, meek and wise; it is the teacher that cannot be removed,
a guide into that righteous way, which, if lived in,
would have kept off this impending storm.
O that they would even now, humbly seek to learn the Christian warfare,
and be earnestly engaged to fight under the banner of Christ,
to know their own hearts`' lusts totally subdued.`"

At another time, being in great pain, she said, "`O sweet Lord Jesus,
that you would be pleased to give me a little ease, who am an unworthy creature,
undeserving of your sweet presence; but you are merciful, and you, O Lord,
know that nothing else can ease and comfort me; your living presence is all I want.`"
Her fervent petition being granted, she broke forth after this manner;
"`O how good is my God, thus to hear my feeble cry,--how sweet is this ease.
All my pains are eased by one look from you!
O that I could be thankful enough for this favour, this sweet though short quiet,
which we cannot get at but when you, O Father, please.
O that the people would but believe, that in your peace their strength consists,
and that they would seek to know it before it is too late.
Many are contented without witnessing the frequent renewings of divine love,
in which only there is life:
if they are but preserved from gross evils and go on in prosperity,
they sit down at ease and think all is well.
O that they may not too late find their mistake,
and that they have pleased themselves with favours which they have unthankfully received;
and stopped short of greater, by not desiring them,
and more frequently than the day waiting to know the renewings of that life,
without which there is no life to the truly begotten children,
and which would not only show them what they ought to do,
but give them strength to do it.`"

_Seventh month 2nd._--Several Friends sitting in her room she said in substance,
"`I have seen the necessity, after having done the will of God,
of waiting in patience to receive the promise of Him, who is the same today as yesterday,
and will so continue forever.
Many are the comfortable assurances in holy writ,
to those who keep the word of his patience: '`I will keep such,`' says he,
'`in the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the earth,
to try them that dwell therein.`' I have many times been glad to
feel a little opening of strength with my beloved friends,
and may say, I am thankful for this solemn quiet opportunity, for great have been,
and still are, my trials, and close may be your provings.
I don`'t speak it to discourage any,
but I find without the renewings of Divine love and life,
we are incapable of keeping the word of his patience,
being so frequently beset with weakness and infirmities.

"`May you, my dear friends, who have been called and anointed for services,
witness a renewed supply of holy oil,
whereby your lamps may be kept burning and your lights shining,
and experience the law to go forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
May you remember your covenants, made in the day of deep distress;
and may you be supported through every future difficulty and trial,
and I through the present conflict,
that when every other channel of comfort shall be dried up,
and all human help be found unavailing, we may find Him to be near, who has promised,
that for the cry of the poor and the sighing of the needy, he will arise:
cry mightily unto Him, that we may know him to do so for us, for I find,
without sensibly feeling his love, which opens and enlarges the heart,
we cannot apply those gracious promises to our comfort.
And when he draws let not the cares of this life,
or slavish and unnecessary fears prevent your following him faithfully,
whatever afflictions may attend.
O may we be so preserved in his holy hand,
as that nothing may be permitted to pluck us out of it,
and be assisted so to conduct ourselves,
as that we may be found among the happy number who have come through many tribulations,
where all sorrows and sighing will be done away, and all tears wiped from our eyes,
to join those who can acceptably sing the song of praise,
having their robes washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.`"

On the 3rd, with some difficulty of utterance she said,
"`Though the floods beat high at times, and the waves roar,
I am sensible of Divine love being present,
and in that love I salute my friends;`" and added,
that as she hoped each one there had in a greater or less degree
known the sanctifying power of religion on their minds,
she very earnestly and affectionately urged them to a more
close and solemn attention to this important work,
and not to rest satisfied short of witnessing a daily advancement therein,
that when this earthly tabernacle was dissolved,
they might have a well grounded hope of a house eternal in the heavens,
whose builder and maker is God.

She then mentioned that "`our blessed Saviour had told his immediate followers,
that in his Father`'s house there were many mansions,
and he went to prepare a place for them, that where he is, they might be also;
and although the sensible enjoyment of Divine love is much withdrawn from many,
who formerly were eminently favoured with it, yet she desired such not to be discouraged,
for living faith in Christ Jesus, though but in a small degree,
is abundantly sufficient for our strength and safety:
and that as the Lord`'s love still continued with those who are far advanced,
and as on the verge of time,
He would also be the guide and blessed guardian of the younger in years,
as they humbly and steadily kept on the watch,
and were obedient to the instructions of his holy Spirit.`"

During the last night of her life,
she was in much pain and under some discouragement of mind;
and being reminded of some past seasons of divine favour,
she lay a while in awful silence, and then exclaimed, "`I see now to my comfort,
that the Lord has been with me through all this illness, and at times I knew it not.`"
She soon fell into a quiet slumber, and on awaking much refreshed,
remarked that she had not slept so sweetly during all her illness,
for she had been in company with her father`'s God, her mother`'s God, and her God;
and after slumbering again, she said,
"`It seems strange I should sleep at such a time
as this,`" but being told that her work was done,
and it was a favour she could sleep, replied, "`I believe it is,
and I am thankful for it.`"
About three o`'clock in the morning she raised her hands as if engaged in fervent prayer,
and uttered some words, which were not intelligibly heard;
soon after which she quietly expired on the 24th of tenth month, 1775,
in the seventy-second year of her age, and thirty-first of her ministry.

=== Memoir of Thomas Upsher

Thomas Upsher was born in the parish of Lexden, borough of Colchester,
and county of Essex, in the sixth month 1672.
He was educated in the profession of a Presbyterian,
and was seriously inclined from his youth,
often seeking the Lord for the good of his soul,
and diligently reading the holy Scriptures.
About the fifteenth year of his age,
he left the Presbyterians and joined the people called general Baptists,
and was zealous in that way, becoming a preacher in much esteem among them.
But it pleased the Lord more effectually to visit his soul, by the light of Christ Jesus,
unto which he turned in living faith,
and came to see the emptiness of his former profession and talk of religion,
without the saving knowledge of God and our Lord Jesus Christ,
which is only attained through the revelation of his Spirit.

He was about twenty years of age when he was convinced of
the blessed Truth as held by the people called Quakers,
and embracing it in the love thereof,
he continued a diligent attender of their meetings for the worship of Almighty God,
waiting upon Him in retirement of spirit and true silence for his teaching and counsel.
At length, it pleased the Lord to bestow on him a gift in the ministry of the gospel,
which he received in great humility, speaking a few words among his brethren,
in much fear and tenderness, to the comfort and refreshment of many.
God, in tender mercy, increased his gift,
so that he became an able and experienced minister of the gospel,
turning many from darkness unto the light of Christ Jesus;
in which service he travelled in most parts of England, and also in Ireland.

In the time of health he was concerned to remember death and spoke of it;
and when taken sick remarked, "`I do not expect to live long in this world;
I have been preparing for a better.
I do not desire to live on my own account--I long
more and more to be at home with my God;
yet I would not be of those who desired the reward before the work is done.
There is nothing here which invites my stay,
but if God has any further service for me in this world, I am given up to his will.`"

In a letter to a particular friend, written in the time of his sickness,
he thus expresses himself:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

When I consider the many changes which we and ours and all we have in this world,
are subject to,
it seems a sufficient antidote against the individual love of temporal things;
and it appears to me,
that it is the lack of due thoughtfulness which makes many so much engaged in them,
as almost wholly to frustrate those religious endeavours which
are necessary in order to make sure our eternal interest.

It is now a long time since I have enjoyed one day of perfect health as heretofore.
I consider it as a preparatory summons from this frail state of being; and I thank God,
I am not altogether unmindful of my duty,
in setting my house in order before the time comes when I must die.
I hope to live in a far better state,
and there to join all the generations of the just that are gone before,
and shall hereafter follow.

--

Several friends being with him, he spoke to them of his death,
and desired they might bear him witness, saying: "`My dependence,
hope and trust is in the Lord Jesus Christ alone,--I do
not value myself upon any qualification or endowment received,
but lay all down as at the feet of Jesus, and am as nothing before him.`"

About two days after this, though weak in body,
he was carried in a coach to the burial of a Friend at Ipswich;
and although he seemed very unfit for the service of the day,
there being many people assembled,
yet the Lord was pleased to strengthen and qualify
him to declare the word of Truth and life,
in the demonstration and power of the Spirit, whereby the people were much affected,
and friends who knew his weakness, admired the love and goodness of God to him.
He appeared stronger after the meeting than before, and continued better for a few days,
but his disorder returned again,
and he was enabled to be very patient under extreme pain, which was so great,
he said no tongue could express it.
Yet he desired to be resigned, and the Lord favoured him with resignation,
faith and patience, through all.

To a friend who came to visit him, he said, "`In all likelihood,
I am now about to take my last leave of you all,
and I pray God from my heart to bless you.`"
Being desired to send for another physician, he answered,
"`No--I am satisfied if God had been pleased to say amen to means,
there has been sufficient used for my recovery;
and therefore I shall have my eye to the Lord only for help.`"
At another time, he said,
"`My tongue is not able to express what I feel of the love and goodness of God,
now when I have most need of it;--the saying used by that plain,
despised people +++[+++the Quakers]
is very true, that, Life is better than words.
There is one thing I cannot find out,
why the Lord should so abound in his love and mercy to me,
who am so unworthy of the least of his mercies.`"

There was great refreshment felt many times in sitting by him in silence;
and on a first-day morning several Friends being in his chamber,
he desired they might wait upon the Lord together,
and the Lord was pleased to open his mouth to praise and magnify his holy name.
He spoke of the blessed state of the faithful, at the sight of which,
he was filled with heavenly joy,
praising the Lord to the comfort of those present--and saying,
"`O that I might declare of the wonders of the Lord,
which I have seen in the deeps--but I am resigned to his will.`"

Speaking of his pains and exercises, he said they were very great; but added,
"`The Lord is very good to me, and bears up my spirit in the midst of them all.`"
Taking leave of some friends who visited him,
he exhorted them so to live that he and they might meet in the mansions
of eternal rest--and desired his dear love to Friends everywhere,
saying, "`They are near to my life--I have true unity with them in spirit.`"
At a meeting in his chamber about two weeks before his death,
the state of the church and many precious gospel truths were opened to him,
and in a heavenly frame of spirit he spoke of the wonderful wisdom,
love and goodness of God,
exhorting Friends to be more faithful and diligent in His blessed cause and service.

A few days before his close, feeling himself a little revived,
he went to meeting and there was engaged in fervent prayer,
praising the Lord in a true sense of his mercy and goodness.
His distemper returning with increased severity, he felt his end drawing near,
and remarked,
"`I desire to die in great humiliation and to commit
my spirit into the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ.`"
When death approached he was in a heavenly frame of mind, and said, "`The Lord,
in the riches of his mercy, will keep all them that trust in him,
under all their trials.`"
He peacefully departed this life the 10th of the eighth month, 1704,
aged thirty-two years.

=== Life of Thomas Aldam

This Friend was one of the earliest converts of George Fox in the county of York.
His mother, wife, and two sisters, were all convinced about the same time,
in the year 1651.
His residence was at Warmsworth, near Doncaster, where it is supposed he was born;
but in what year is not ascertained.

Previous to his knowledge of George Fox,
he appears to have been a man religiously disposed,
and was much attached to some of the ministers of that day,
probably those called Puritans, who at that time, having overturned Episcopacy,
took possession of the places of public worship and the livings of their predecessors.
With these, however, he became dissatisfied,
for he aspired after a greater degree of spiritual
light and purity than he had yet met with.
Such was his condition, when George Fox came into the neighbourhood of his residence,
through whose ministry he was effectually turned from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan unto God.

The doctrine of the Divine Light, or the Spirit of Christ illuminating the soul,
and opening to it the way of life and salvation, was readily acknowledged by him;
through which he was drawn from a dependence on his former teachers,
separated from the ways of the world,
and qualified to bear a living testimony to the Truth,
inviting others to "`taste and see how good the Lord is.`"

In his ministerial labours, he was not only exercised in the meetings of Friends,
but often attended the public places of worship,
where he was frequently concerned to speak of the things of God,
and at times to testify against the conduct both of the priests and people.
He was thus engaged at Warmsworth, Hatfield, Wickersley, Edlington, Tickhill, Bawtry,
Thorne, Handsworth, Rossington, and Pontefract.
In almost all these places he met with very rude, severe treatment; but at Thorne,
when the priest ordered the constable to "`take out that rude and uncivil fellow,
who came in so uncivilly and made a disturbance;`" the constable
being of a different spirit from the priest,
replied: "`He disturbs no man, nor does any man harm.`"
After the priest had finished his sermon, Thomas Aldam preached to the people.
Some of the rude sort, following the example of their priest, reviled him; and,
not content with words, proceeded to blows, both with their hands and feet,
and even spit upon him, turning him out of their church, as they called it.
This may serve as rather a favourable specimen of the treatment,
which he generally met with on these occasions.

About the year 1652, in consequence of a concern of this kind at Warmsworth,
he was committed to York Castle by Darcy Wentworth, John Copley, George Byard,
and Thomas Westby, justices.
It is likely he was the first Friend who was imprisoned
in that place for his religious principles,
and he was continued a prisoner about two years and a half;
during which time he was not only prevented from visiting his family,
but his wife and relations frequently were not permitted to visit him.

During this long confinement, he was brought to trial before Judge Parker;
but Thomas Aldam declining from conscientious motives to
pay the judge the usual compliment of taking off the hat,
and likewise addressing him in the singular number,
with some remonstrances on his conduct, the judge fined him forty pounds,
and committed him to prison with an order that he
should be kept close prisoner till he paid it;
but, on application to Oliver Cromwell, an order was given for his liberation.
He bore his sufferings with much patience, under a sense of the Lord`'s goodness to him;
and had many opportunities of religious service,
and of remonstrating with the judges and justices,
on the cruelties which they imposed on an innocent people.

Besides this imprisonment,
he also suffered much in his property for not paying
tithes and other ecclesiastical demands.
So great was the enmity of the priest of Warmsworth,
that after all his cows had been taken from him,
and he had borrowed one of a relation to supply his family with milk,
the cruel priest threatened to take that away also.
This priest, however, was reduced to poverty,
his own children prodigally spending his property, and he himself died suddenly.

Though Thomas Aldam was a great sufferer, both in body and property,
on account of his religious principles, yet his feelings were not confined to himself,
but were extended to his suffering Friends, in various parts of the nation;
for whose relief he travelled much in England, Scotland, and Ireland,
visiting them in their prisons,
and laying their distressing situations before those in authority.
It was on one of these occasions, when applying to Oliver Cromwell for relief,
that he took off his cap before the Protector, and tore it to pieces, saying:
"`So shall your government be torn from you and your house.`"
This prediction he just lived to see fulfilled, dying in the year 1660.

In his last illness, he experienced much inward support and resignation to the event.
At one time he felt his strength so renewed, that he thought he could go to London,
if required; but soon added: "`I am clear of the blood of all men.
I feel nothing to this man,`" meaning Charles the Second,
who was then just restored to his crown.
The day before he died, he called his children together,
and after giving them some advice, took his leave of them,
and the next day resigned his soul into the hands of his Creator.

From the character I find given of this Friend,
he appears to have been possessed of many excellent qualities.
He was a man of great courage and firmness of mind,
and being fully dedicated to the service of God and the support of his religious principles,
he laboured and suffered much in that day of violence and persecution.
While his testimony was sharp against evil-doers,
he was very tender towards those in whom he discovered sincere
desires towards God and the knowledge of his Truth.
He was a man of universal charity, manifesting a disposition to do good unto all men,
and thus showing forth the praise of Him who had
called him out of darkness into his marvellous light.

In his own family, to use the words of his son, "`He was often very brokenhearted,
watching over his children in the fear of the Lord.
And when I remember the fervency of spirit which did attend him, and how,
when he was going to take a journey on Truth`'s account,
he would call his wife and children,
and in great tenderness and humility bow his knees before the Lord,
and pour out his supplications unto Him,
desiring earnestly that the Lord might go with him, and committing us into his keeping;
and what brokenness of heart was among us at such times,
and how the love of God did abound, then can my soul say, those were precious seasons,
and are not to be forgotten by us; but to be recorded to posterity,
that we may tell our children, and they also may declare, when we are gone,
how good the Lord has been unto his people, and what great cause they have to love Him,
and put their trust in Him; that so his name may be renowned among our families,
so long as they shall have a being.`"

It has already been noticed that Thomas Aldam`'s mother, wife, and two sisters,
were all convinced by George Fox.
Of the mother we find no further notice.
His wife survived him only about three months: she was a relio-ious woman,
"`of a very meek and quiet spirit, given up in all things to God`'s disposing.`"

His two sisters, Margaret Kellam and Joan Kellam,
continued faithful to the convictions they had received,
and were both serviceable women in the Society,
Margaret travelled much in Truth`'s service, and many were convinced by her.
She suffered imprisonment in several places, as Exeter, Banbury, and York.
"`Great,`" says her nephew, "`was the boldness that did attend her,
in sounding forth the truth, in the streets, steeple-houses, and marketplaces,
and to the heads and rulers of the people; and the Lord was with her.
She finished her course in the faith, signifying to a near relation,
before her departure, the great peace she enjoyed with the Lord,
and the clearness of conscience she had before him.`"
She died in the year 1672.

Joan Kellam died in the year 1681, having been a very useful woman,
and of much religious experience, by which she became as a mother in Israel,
and a tender sympathizer with those who were in a state of suffering,
whether in body or in mind.

=== Life of William Ames

We have no account of the birth of William Ames, or of his native country,
except that John Whiting mentions him as being of Somersetshire.
In his youth he was of a cheerful temper,
and fond of the society of those of similar dispositions; but,
in the gay and unguarded indulgence of this inclination,
he was often disquieted in his mind; and, in consequence,
became a closer follower of the priests and teachers.
He also exercised himself diligently in reading the Holy Scriptures, which,
though it is a practice very excellent in itself,
was not sufficient to bring him to true peace of mind with the Lord.

Though he was of a quick understanding,
and capable of deducing much argument from the Scriptures; yet he appears, for a time,
not to have been favoured with the Key of David,
which only can unlock and open that rich treasury,
and furnish from those abundant stores, the food convenient for the seeking, hungry soul.

In this unsatisfied condition of mind,
he entered into religious communion with the Baptist society,
and became a teacher among them.
At this period he was more strict and careful of his conduct,
and endeavoured to avoid the committing of sins;
yet he found that the root from which they sprung was alive in him;
and when he met with anything contrary to his own will, anger soon prevailed.
Few appear to have been more fully and clearly taught
the doctrine of the blessed Redeemer of men,
when he said: "`Without me you can do nothing.`"

He could speak of justification, sanctification, and cleansing by the blood of Jesus,
but was sensible he had not attained that pure washing;
and even perceived that he was no true member of Christ,
because he had not experienced regeneration.
Thus he learned that a high profession was of no avail,
and that something beyond it was essential to enable him to attain a happy condition.

Though he was thus clearly sensible of one thing still lacking; and, on committing sin,
felt in himself a swift witness against it, a monitor that struck him with terror;
yet he did not comprehend what it was which in mercy thus disquieted his soul.

In addition to the ministerial office which he had taken upon himself,
he likewise engaged as an officer in the army.
In this capacity he maintained a strict life himself,
and kept his soldiers under severe discipline;
and when any of them were guilty of immorality on the first-day of the week,
he had them put under confinement and restraint.

At length, in the year 1655,
while Edward Burrough and Francis Howgill were at Cork in Ireland,
he heard one or both of them preach, declaring that what convinces man of sin,
is the _Light of Christ,_ which enlightens every man that comes into the world.
This doctrine entered so deeply into his heart, that he embraced it,
from a firm conviction of its being the Truth;
and walking with great circumspection and fear before the Lord, he found,
that by diligent attention to that Divine principle
which inwardly reproved and condemned him for evil,
he came to be delivered from the power of sin, and to witness sanctification.

He entered into the Society of the despised Quakers,
and continuing in the way of godliness,
he became a zealous preacher of that doctrine which
had so deeply penetrated his own heart.

In the year 1657, we find him at Amsterdam,
in company with a person of the name of Humble Thatcher,
who does not appear ever to have been fully in communion with our religious Society.
It seems, from the circumstance of their being companions,
and from William Ames being a man of extraordinary courage and boldness,
that they were taken up,
on suspicion of having placed a paper on the door of the English meetinghouse,
in that city; but of this charge William declared himself innocent;
and also that he knew not who was the author of the paper.
This happened at the time when many false reports were in print, concerning the Quakers,
which probably occasioned the magistrates to be more apprehensive respecting them;
and sending for William Ames and his companion to appear before them,
they were commanded to depart the town in twenty-four hours.

Persuaded of their own innocency,
these courageous and resolute men did not think proper to obey the command.
The next day, from a conscientious scruple,
not putting off their hats when before the magistrates,
they were falsely considered as not owning the subordination due to rulers;
and after being kept in custody for some days,
they were at night led through the Regulars gate, and banished out of the town.

William Ames judging that he had committed no evil, returned the next day into the city,
and passed the great market-place called the Dam.
On this occasion it is said that some of the magistrates saw him and observed:
"`Lo! there is the Quaker; if we had a mind now to make martyrs,
here would be an opportunity for it.`"
But it seems, as there was no proof of their having done any evil,
the magistrates deemed it safest to wink at his return.

He stayed some time in the city, and the doctrine which he preached found some entrance,
even among a few of the collegians.
At this time also his ministry proved convincing to Jacob Williamson Sewel, of Utretcht,
free citizen and surgeon, resident at Amsterdam, and Judith Zinspenning his wife,
who were the parents of William Sewel, the historian of our Society, and a lexicographer.
These, with two or three more, were the first of our religious persuasion at Amsterdam.

In the preface to [.book-title]#William Sewel`'s History,#
he mentions William Ames as having had considerable influence
with several collegians when he was first at Amsterdam,
who were so fully convinced of the doctrine he preached, that they approved of it;
and one of them, Adam Boreels, so early as the year 1662, is supposed by William Sewel,
to have written a treatise in Latin,
with a title signifying _The Light upon the Candlestick,_
which contained the doctrines preached by William Ames,
and was so expressed in the title page.
This treatise is translated into English,
and forms an appendix to [.book-title]#William Sewel`'s History of our Society.#

About the year 1659, William Ames went into Germany,
and visited the court of the Prince Elector, Charles Lodowick,
who treated him kindly even at his own table,
and seemed not to take any offense at his hat being kept on,
though the lords and others present were uncovered.
On one occasion, as Ames was walking next the prince, in his garden, with his hat on,
the courtiers inquired of the prince, if they should question Ames for doing so;
but this he would not permit them to do.

At another time the prince fixed to have both his
chaplain and William Ames to dine with him,
with a view, it seems, that William, whom he knew to be a bold man,
might find occasion to reprove the chaplain.
For this purpose, when they were at dinner, the prince permitted his jester to come in,
and on playing his tricks the chaplain was silent.
William Ames took occasion from this circumstance to reprove such vain actions;
but chiefly aimed his remarks at the chaplain, whom,
for his silence at the lewd remarks of the jester, he censured in very plain terms;
which, however, appeared to afford satisfaction to the prince.
This fact marks the uprightness, boldness,
and firm integrity of the character of William Ames.

At Kriesheim, a town in the Palatinate, not far from Worms,
he found such entrance among the Baptists,
that some families not only received the doctrine he preached,
but bore public testimony for it there, till the settlement of Pennsylvania,
when they unanimously went to that province,
and thus providentially escaped the distresses which
were occasioned by the war not long after;
in which the Palatinate was laid waste by the French,
and thousands were bereaved of their possessions and reduced to poverty.

The conviction which attended the ministry of William Ames,
in the hearts of some persons in the Palatinate,
occasioned a fine to be settled on those who gave him entertainment;
but the Prince Elector being informed of it, not only took off the fine,
but ordered some of the Consistory, who had sent for William,
to desist from molesting him.
The Prince`'s sister also behaved very kindly towards William Ames,
and received his exhortations favourably.

The next year he went again into the Palatinate, with John Higgins,
and visited the Prince Elector; he also sent a letter to the Prince,
with a book written by George Fox, of which John Higgins appears to have been the bearer.
From the captain of the prince`'s guard,
they understood that he was glad of William Ames`' return;
and the prince himself desired John Higgins to thank
William Ames for the letter and book;
and added, that he took their visit to him and his family very kindly,
and believed that what they spoke was in love to their souls.

William Ames also went to Hamburgh, Bohemia, and Dantzick,
and from the latter into Poland; but it is not certain in what year.
At Hamburgh and Dantzick he met with some who received the doctrine he preached;
but in Poland the people were rude and haughty.

In the forepart of the year 1659, he went to Rotterdam,
where he and one Martin Martinson, who had been convinced by him,
were imprisoned in the Bedlam, for having a meeting at Martinson`'s house.
The latter lived at Moordecht, a village near Gouda,
and was in the practice of holding a meeting sometimes in his own house,
with some of his sober-minded neighbours, which caused a great commotion in the town;
and after a meeting held there, at which William Ames was present,
they experienced much rude treatment.
In consequence of this, they had some conversation with a preacher,
who charged William Ames with being a wolf and deceiver.
William was desirous of having an opportunity of clearing himself,
and by means of Martin Martinson got a time fixed
for the priest to undertake the proof of his assertion;
but instead of doing so, he had recourse to a less troublesome expedient,
and procured civil officers, who took them both into custody.

After being confined a little more than three weeks in Bedlam,
the under governor indirectly expressed a wish that they would escape;
saying that he should not hinder them.
William Ames, not choosing to be reputed one who broke prison,
concluded the conversation with saying: "`Well, I intend to go out tomorrow.`"
The next day they were permitted to go out, and William went with the deputy,
before the dikegrave, not choosing to leave the town without seeing him.
The dikegrave behaved moderately; but not judging it eligible for them to be released,
expressed a desire for them to return to the prison, with which they complied,
and were detained some time longer, before they were set at liberty.
William then proceeded on his journey in Germany,
and from there returned to his native country;
but after some time he went again to Holland,
probably with an intention of settling there.

In 1662, he was taken from a Friend`'s house in London,
with Samuel Fisher and three others, and suffered a severe imprisonment in Bridewell;
but his health not being equal to endure such severity, he was released,
lest he should die there.
Such was the rage of persecution at that time,
that not only public meetings were interrupted, but private houses were broken into,
and friendly visits were construed into meetings contrary to law.

His settled abode at this time was at Amsterdam, to which place, after his release,
he returned, with his health much impaired;
and he did not very long survive the effects of the severity he endured in Bridewell.
In the course of his sickness, which was lingering, he was informed, that,
among the Baptists and collegians, it was reported, he had changed his sentiments,
and was grieved for having judged them wrongfully.
This he denied; and said that he still judged their way of worship,
especially their disputations and will-worship, to be out of the way of the Lord.
In this belief he continued, and died in peace.
This was in the latter part of the year 1662.

William Sewel thus concludes his account of this bold advocate,
of the Light of Christ in the Heart.
"`He was indeed a zealous man, and though some were ready to think he was too zealous,
yet he was discreet; and I know that he was condescending in indifferent matters,
thinking that there were customs, which though not followed in one country,
were yet tolerable in another.
He was also generous; and lest he might seem burdensome to any,
he rather chose to work with his own hands.`"
He did this, at wool-combing, during his last imprisonment in London.

He published several small works,
which are enumerated in John Whiting`'s Catalogue of Friends`' Books.
In this list appears to be included The Light upon the Candlestick,
already noticed in this memoir; and from his name being in the title page,
John Whiting might suppose he was the author of it.

=== Life of Samuel Fisher

The conversion of Samuel Fisher to the principles of the Quakers,
appears to have been the effect of the ministry of William Caton and John Stubbs.
The time and place of his birth is not ascertained.
He was educated at one of the universities, and entering into holy orders,
as they are called, he first became chaplain to some person of quality,
and afterwards was made priest of Lydd in Kent,
a living at that time worth about two hundred pounds per annum.
While in this situation, he was requested by the master of Luke Howard,
an apprentice to a shoemaker at Dover,
to converse with the young man respecting a scruple which he entertained
about the singing of David`'s Psalms in places of public worship.
Luke Howard explained the reasons of his uneasiness with that practice in such a manner,
that Fisher, rather than he, was altered in opinion on the subject.

The arguments used on this occasion were these, that God is a Spirit,
and must be worshipped in spirit and in truth; but that it was contrary to truth,
for a proud man to sing, that he was not puffed up in mind, that he had no scornful eye,
and did not exercise himself in things too high for him.
Further, to sing, "`rivers of tears run down my eyes,
because other men keep not your law,`" when those who thus sing,
never knew true repentance for their own sins, was such a violation of common morality,
as true religion could not sanction.

By this conversation, Samuel Fisher,
who had already entertained some dissatisfaction
with various matters connected with his present employment,
grew more uneasy with it.
Preaching for hire, and the baptism of infants, became a burden to his tender,
feeling mind;
and so great was his dedication to that which appeared to be his religious duty,
that he voluntarily resigned his lucrative situation,
took a farm for the support of his family,
and joined himself in society with the Baptists, by whom he was highly esteemed;
and he became a minister among them.

When William Caton and John Stubbs went into those parts,
he hospitably entertained them in his house;
and their gospel labours made some impression on his mind,
though he did not then acknowledge it.
After leaving Lydd, and visiting some places thereabout, they returned there again,
when they found their former labours had been blessed,
and many persons were now ready to join them.
George Hammond, however, a Baptist preacher, publicly preached against them;
which gave Samuel Fisher so much uneasiness, that he stood up in the same meeting,
and said to Hammond: "`Dear brother, you are very near and dear to me,
but the truth is nearer and dearer.
This is the everlasting truth and gospel.`"
This was very trying to Hammond; and, with a mixture of anger and sorrow, he exclaimed:
"`Our brother Fisher is also bewitched.`"
Fisher made no reply, but attaching himself still more closely to Caton and Stubbs,
he joined the religious Society to which they belonged.
This was in the year 1655.

In the following year Cromwell convened the parliament,
which met on the 17th of the seventh month, in the Painted Chamber, Whitehall.
Samuel Fisher had been under a great exercise for several days,
from an apprehension of duty to go there at that time,
and to deliver what he considered a message from the Lord to the Protector and Parliament.
After much secret conflict of spirit, he resigned himself to this duty,
and went to the Painted Chamber at the time appointed.
The Protector made a long speech, in the course of which he said,
he knew not of one man that suffered imprisonment unjustly in England.
As soon as Cromwell had finished his speech,
Fisher attempted to deliver what was upon his mind;
but he had proceeded a very little in his intended speech,
before he was interrupted with the cry of, "`A Quaker, a Quaker; keep him down,
he shall not speak.`"
He however proceeded as long as he possibly could,
and believed the Protector and Parliament men would have heard him,
had not others violently opposed and prevented his speaking.

Being thus prevented from verbally communicating that which was upon his mind,
he committed it to writing and published it.
The following quotation will show the very low opinion
he entertained of the then ruling party in the nation,
and the plainness of speech with which he delivered his message,
or rather the message of the Lord, to them.

After some introductory words, he expresses himself thus:

[quote]
____

You are a seed of evil doers, says the Lord; a hypocritical generation,
a people whose heart is not right, and whose spirit is not steadfast with the Lord.
You have made many shows of seeking my face, but you have not found it,
because you have not sought it in sincerity.
You have talked much of turning unto me,
but you have never done it yet with all your hearts; but feignedly, says the Lord.
You have seemed much to inquire after me in your long prayers,
as if you did delight to know my ways; but my ways, which are ways of purity, peace,
and pleasantness, though grievous to the wicked, you yet know not,
so well as you might do, did you stand in my counsel;
and so far forth as you do know of them, you have no delight to walk in them,
so strait and rugged are they to that nature which you yet remain in.
You call out to me after light, as if you were very desirous to be enlightened;
but you are haters of my light and my life, says the Lord,
even the light in the conscience which I have placed in every one of you.
This you come not closely to, lest you should be reproved by it,
but love darkness more than it, because your deeds are evil.

You have fasted often and hung down your heads like a bulrush for a day;
but you have never yet fasted unto me, says the Lord, You find your own pleasure still;
the bands of wickedness are not loosed;
you are captivated still in the cords of your own sins; neither have you,
in the midst of all your abstinence,
abstained yet from the fleshly lusts which war against your souls;
but are as proud as ever, as pompous and vain as ever, as luxurious and careless;
as covetous and earthly-minded; as self-seeking; as time-serving; as men-pleasing;
as oppressing and unrighteous as before.
You have often fasted for, but never fully from, your iniquities to this day,
says the Lord.
You would be counted professors, yes promoters of religion,
but are indeed persecutors of the very life and power,
and of that people that do believe in the life and power of that same religion,
which in form and words you have long professed.
____

After a long remonstrance of this kind,
and laying before Oliver and his Parliament the great inconsistency of their conduct,
with the spirit of Christianity; and predicting their disgrace and downfall,
he concludes thus:

[quote]
____

What shall one then answer the messengers of the nations?
Even this, that the Lord has founded Zion,
and the poor of his people have betaken themselves unto it.
But all luxurious, careless, and covetous worldlings,
all formal professors and dissembling hypocrites, painted sepulchres and whited walls,
base backsliders, and filthy liars, hireling priests and fawning prophets,
and all proud oppressors and wicked opposers, and persecutors of Christ in his people,
can have no share in it; but are shut out into the lake,
and gone down forever with the uncircumcised into the pit,
which has shut her mouth upon them there, world without end, to be confounded.
____

Thus plainly did our early Friends deal with that "`hypocritical
generation,`" who under pretensions of promoting liberty,
both civil and religious,
had proved more cruel persecutors than those who had gone before them,
and many of them became so darkened in their understandings,
as even to plead for persecution and to pray against the spreading of a spirit of toleration.
No wonder then that the indignation both of God and of good
men was kindled against such a people as this.

The 24th of the seventh month was appointed a day for a public fast and humiliation;
and Samuel Fisher again attempted to relieve his exercised mind in a public manner.
For this purpose he attended the parish worship house called St. Margaret`'s,
in Westminster, This was the place where the members of parliament were to attend.
After two of their ministers had finished their sermons,
Fisher attempted to relieve his mind, but with no better success than before.
He therefore had recourse to the same expedient,
and committed to writing the substance of what he would have verbally communicated.
Indeed it is probable he rather enlarged than contracted it;
as the piece consists of eight folio pages,
and contains much excellent advice as well as close remonstrance
on various subjects relating to their public and private conduct.

In the year 1659, he accompanied Edward Burrough to Dunkirk,
where they visited the Capuchin and other Friars; also the Jesuits;
and had some discourse with them on the subject of the Light of Christ;
and warned them of the day that would come upon their idolatrous ways, worships,
and works.
They had also religious meetings with the English soldiers and their officers;
Dunkirk being at that time in possession of the English.
They were sent for on their landing by Colonel Alsop, deputy-governor to Lockhart,
and when Lockhart returned he also sent for them.
To these persons they explained the nature of their concern,
and were civilly treated by them.

Having performed their service at Dunkirk, they returned to England,
and in the following year Samuel Fisher and John Stubbs went to Rome,
where they entered into conversation with some of the cardinals,
and testified against the Popish superstitions.
They also distributed books, explanatory of their principles, among the friars,
some of whom confessed to the truth of their doctrine;
but said that if they should acknowledge this publicly, they might expect to be burnt.
Fisher and Stubbs, however, met with no interruption or molestation.
In the course of their journey they underwent many difficulties,
travelling on foot over the Alps, and in the countries through which they had to pass;
but that Divine hand which led them forth, protected and delivered them;
and brought them safely back to their native land.

After his return to England,
Samuel Fisher was seldom out of prison for his religious conduct and principles.
In the year 1661, he was arrested at a meeting in Westminster,
and committed to the Gatehouse, where he was continued a prisoner for several months,
in a small hole, without a chimney, during a cold season of the year.
After his release from this imprisonment,
he was apprehended as he was walking the streets of London,
and with nine others was committed to Wood-street Compter,
where the accommodation was so small,
that there was not room for all of them to lie down at once.
Being taken before the magistrates at Guildhall,
the oaths of allegiance and supremacy were tendered to him,
which of course refusing to take, he was committed to Newgate,
where he continued sixteen weeks.

He could not have been long at liberty, before he was again made a prisoner;
for on the 21st of the third month, 1662, he was arrested in a private house,
by a company of soldiers, who showed no cause for their violent conduct,
nor any warrant but their swords.
After being hurried from place to place, he was at last brought before Richard Brown,
a man factitious, or rather infamous, for his violent persecuting spirit.
By him Fisher was committed to Bridewell.
The next day his court order was changed,
and the charge on which he was committed was for unlawfully assembling to worship.
After an imprisonment of six weeks, he was brought up to the sessions at the Old Bailey,
where, instead of a legal trial on the subject of his court order,
the oath was again administered to him contrary to law, in his situation as a prisoner.
He desired the law to be read that required him to take the oath, which, though promised,
was not done, but only the form of the oath was read to him.
Even when this was done, time was not afforded for him to give a reply,
but the magistrates immediately ordered him to be taken away,
a command which the officers executed with that violence
which they knew would be acceptable to their superiors.
On leaving the court, Samuel Fisher addressed it with these few emphatic words:
"`If such doings as these ever prosper, it must be when there is no God.`"

He was now committed to Newgate, where he continued a prisoner about twelve months,
many of his friends being in confinement there at the same time.
This dear Friend might indeed say with the apostle, "`In every place,
bonds and afflictions abide me.`"
Before the expiration of the year 1663,
a great part of which must have elapsed previous to his liberation from Newgate,
he was again arrested and committed to prison.
While attending a meeting at Charlewood in Surry,
he was taken and committed to the White Lion Jail in Southwark.

Here he continued a prisoner till the time of his death,
which took place on the last day of the sixth month, 1665.
Concerning his decease we find no particulars, except that Sewel says he "`died piously.`"

It appears from various accounts,
that Samuel Fisher was a man of a most amiable disposition and manners.
Ellis Hookes, Luke Howard, and William Penn, all speak very highly of his virtues.
The latter says, "`Though I greatly valued his abilities,
employed so accurately in a good cause;
yet above all I cannot but admire and love his great self-denial and humility,
who from being a teacher, became willing to be taught;
and that most evenness and sweetness of temper his
most intimate friends have often observed in him;
so that he was not only a good scribe, but a good liver;
a Christian according to the apostle James, composed of faith and works;
therefore is his name of good savour with the righteous, because he counted nothing dear,
in comparison of the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
which came not by flesh and blood, but by the revelation of the Father of Lights.`"
This testimony of William Penn is abundantly confirmed by his intimate friends,
Ellis Hookes and Luke Howard,
who speak highly of his Christian virtues and patient
suffering for the testimony of Jesus.

=== A Memoir of Richard Samble, A Minister of the Gospel, in the Religious Society of Friends

Richard Samble, a faithful servant of God, and minister of Jesus Christ,
was born at Penhall, in the parish of Enoder, in Cornwall,
and baptized in the manner of the Church of England, the 24th of the fifth month, 1644.
He was educated in that profession, in which he walked in his youth,
seeking the Lord with earnest breathings and cries to him;
being sensible of something within his own mind that manifested sin,
and kept him from some evils.
But he knew not what it was, till the Lord called him by his grace,
and revealed his Son in him;
and then he saw it was the light of Christ which shined in darkness,
though the darkness comprehended it not.
He came to the knowledge of the Truth about the year 1666,
at which time the Lord sent some of his messengers into those parts,
to make known the way of salvation and to turn the people from darkness to light.
He received and closed in with their testimony,
and like Ephraim lamented his misspent time, under a form without the power of godliness;
saying, "`What have I to do any more with idols?`"
Now he joined himself to the Lord and his people,
as in a perpetual covenant never to be broken,
and in humility sat down in their assemblies for several years, in tenderness,
fear and trembling; waiting upon the Lord for wisdom,
till his heart was filled with the power of the Lord, like a vessel with new wine.
Sometimes he would break forth with a few sentences, which gradually increased,
and improving in his gift with great diligence,
he had a large and living testimony to bear in the authority of Truth.

He travelled much in England and Wales for about six years,
and was well received from the evidence and demonstration
of the spirit and power of God that attended his ministry,
to the comfort and confirmation of many in the Truth.
On his return he worked diligently at his trade, being a tailor,
for the support of his family, though he was much drawn forth to travel;
missing no opportunity, as he said, where he saw life`'s way clearly open before him,
knowing his time was but short; giving himself up, though at times in weakness,
to spend and be spent for the gospel`'s sake.

He wrote many epistles to Friends;
in the first of which he commemorates the goodness
of the Lord in visiting them when they were in darkness,
and in a state of separation from God;
in a sense of which they went mourning without the Son of righteousness;
their candle did not shine, their day was not dawned;
they were shut up in the night of apostasy, where God is forgotten,
and his wondrous works not known.
"`Can a remnant,`" says he, "`forget the Lord,
who appeared to their comfort in the time of grief and desperate sorrow;
who were like the doves of the valley, everyone mourning for the loss of his beloved;
crying out in the night because of fears, and in the day time very heavy,
and the cheerful countenance and beauty passed away,
and the sun as it were gone down at noon.
And as we considered the blessed state of the church in time past,
and the soul satisfaction which they enjoyed,
when they ate their bread with joy and singleness of heart, we were like them of old,
that wept when they remembered Zion,
hanging their harps upon the willows by the rivers of Babylon,
and could not sing the Lord`'s song in a strange land; and were ready to say,
we shall not see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.`"
But the Lord caused his day to dawn, and the sun of his eternal love to arise upon them.

John Whiting says, "`I knew him from his first coming forth,
and was affected with his ministry in my young days,
having as sweet a testimony as any that came out of the west.`"
He adorned his testimony, by a circumspect life: he was very temperate;
and all things were so sanctified to him in the fear of the Lord,
that he was a sweet savour in his day.
His wife did not remember that ever she heard him speak
an unsavoury word during the twelve years she was his wife,
and contented in every condition; exhorting his wife and children to live in God`'s fear.
And in the church he was as a nursing father; never sparing his labour,
though many times through much difficulty, to visit the people of God; both in season,
and out of season, rebuking some, exhorting others,
and comforting and confirming many in that heavenly power, that did accompany him;
being willing to serve the Lord, with all his heart, mind, understanding and strength.

About the first month 1680, in his travels, he was taken sick at Poole, in Dorsetshire,
where he wrote an epistle to Friends in Cornwall,
to comfort them in relation to his departure, being likely as he said,
to see their faces no more.

To Friends in Cornwall

[.salutation]
Dear Friends,--

I send this salutation, as though it were my last unto you;
wherein I take my leave of you in the Lord Jesus Christ,
desiring you all may obey the Truth, and live and die in it.
And the many sweet and heavenly opportunities which my soul has had with you,
are fresh in my remembrance.
And now, dear hearts, my body grows very weak; but my soul is strong in the Lord,
who has greatly renewed the lasting seal of his love unto my soul this morning.
Oh! how could I sleep,
when my heart was so awakened unto the blessed sense of my acquaintance with the Lord,
which sounded through my soul,
that my name should not be blotted out of the book of life, and of the holy city,
the heavenly Jerusalem, whose foundation is full of precious stones,
and the river of the water of life flows; where the gates are not shut all day,
neither is any night there: which, when my soul heard,
my heart was dissolved and broken within me,
and my head was as it were turned into water, and my eyes gushed out with tears,
in the consideration of the endless love of God, to such a poor creature as me.

Now, dear Friends, who are truly near me in the Lord,
you know the time of our first knowledge and acquaintance, which was a time of love,
and to this day my heart is filled with the same towards you; though I am likely,
as to the outward, to see your faces no more.

Oh Friends! be not ensnared nor entangled with the things of this world,
nor let your minds go out of Truth,
and so lose the everlasting stay and support of your souls in the last day;
but rather let all go, and hold fast the Truth,
and keep your hearts from being over run with the world`'s spirit;
and so will the Spirit of Truth spring up in you, as a well to refresh your souls.

And all you, whose hearts are truly tendered to the Lord,
whose trials and exercises are not a few, be not daunted nor discouraged,
although the enemy may seek to frighten you with many temptations,
and would seek to lead you out of the fellowship with, or sweet remembrance of,
your dying day, which exercise my soul has sometimes passed under.
But blessed be the Lord forever, the enemy is found a liar;
for the Lord has been pleased to make this sick bed to me better than a king`'s palace;
and I have great fellowship with my last day; and do rejoice in the Lord,
who does so sweetly visit me with the glorious light of his countenance.
It is with me, as it is with one who has travelled many weary journeys,
and at last is come to the sight of his desired end; which, when he sees,
greatly rejoices, in a sense of a further satisfaction which he shall after enjoy;
even so it is with me, who have passed no opportunity,
where I saw the way of life clear and open before me,
but have been ready night and day to do the will, and answer the requirings of the Lord;
and so running, as in a race, knowing my time, that it is but short.
And blessed be the Lord,
I have great peace and satisfaction in this my weak and low condition; and satisfied,
seeing my lot was not at this time among you,
that it is here in this place and I hope it will be well, whether I live or die.

And so my dear and well beloved Friends, dwell in love one with another,
walking in the unspotted life,
so shall you grow up as pleasant plants in the garden of the Lord,
and the dew of life will more and more descend upon you,
and this you will feel from day to day; and when you shall come to your latter end,
your reward will be sure with the Lord.

I have much in my heart towards you, but my strength fails me; only this I desire of you,
seeing I am likely to leave my wife and tender babes with you,
whom I know not whether I shall see more, great is my love and tender respect to them,
for we have lived from the beginning as two joined together by the Lord,
who gave us victory over the world; believing, that when I am gone,
the care of my God will be over them; and I have been a tender father to them,
and they have been to me tender children, and my wife has been to me, as bone of my bone,
and flesh of my flesh, yet I must leave both her and them unto the Lord.

And this I would leave with you, my dear brethren and sisters,
who have known me from the beginning, that you esteem of her, when I am gone,
as one who was wife to him, that was made willing in his day,
to spend and be spent for God`'s truth, and his church`'s sake;
and I desire you in the Lord Jesus Christ,
that my dear wife may meet with no discouragements from you; she is a tender woman;
and that you will be encouragers of her.
I know when this comes to your hands, there will be no lack of sorrow;
but I trust in my God,
that both my dear wife and you will be so endowed
with the power and presence of the Lord,
that if you should hear of my going from here, that you will conclude,
as becomes true Christians, that you must come to me, and that I cannot come to you.

And so my dear Friends, in the opening free love of God,
which this morning my soul is visited with, I dearly salute you,
desiring the Lord may be a husband to my dear wife, and a father to my children,
and you friends to both.

And whereas I have never been deficient in my labour
and service for the glory of the Lord,
and your good, when with you; and if the Lord yet lengthen my days,
I trust I shall be as ready and as willing as ever I have been.
So I conclude in a sweet and living sense of that love, which will never die.
Your friend and brother in the immortal seed of life.

Poole, the 1st of the First month, 1680.

--

After six or seven weeks, having recovered a little strength,
he was desirous to return home to his wife and children in Cornwall;
and in order thereto, he travelled, though weak, to Topsham,
where he was kindly received and entertained; and resting a few days,
he proceeded about ten miles further westward, to a place called Clampet,
near Moreton in Devonshire, where he had a relapse.

His wife came to him; and the day before his departure, taking leave of her, he said,
"`Oh! my dear wife, the Lord will be to you a husband,
and a father to our little children, as you abide faithful to Him.`"
Then after a few words more to her, he prayed a considerable time; yes,
as long as life did last, he was praising and magnifying the Lord.
And to a Friend, who visited him a little before his death,
he declared how well it was with him that he gave up to the Lord`'s requirings,
to spend and be spent for the church`'s sake; and said,
he knew his time would be but short, and labours,
travels and exercises would have their end, and be no more;
with many more heavenly expressions, in much tenderness,
with tears running down his cheeks; which was a great comfort to the Friends present.
And on the 15th of the third month 1680,
he finished his testimony and slept with his fathers,
in the thirty-sixth year of his age, and is entered into rest from his labours,
and his works follow him, having left a sweet savour behind him.
His body was accompanied by many Friends, about 26 miles to Kingsbridge,
and buried there the 18th of the same.

in the testimony of his monthly meeting,
he is called "`Evan Bevan alias Jevans,`" and so he sometimes signed himself,
but generally only, "`Evan Bevan.`"]
was the son of Charles Bevan of Lantwit Vardre, in Glamorganshire,
and was born about the year 1678.
His father having determined to give him a liberal education,
sent him to the university of Oxford,
where he made considerable progress in various parts of literature.
He subsequently applied himself to the study and practice of the law in Glamorganshire,
and served the office of deputy-sheriff of that county with reputation.
But after a time,
he was visited in an extraordinary manner with the convictions of the Holy Spirit;
and while judgment was thus passing over the transgressing nature in him,
he was brought into deep sorrow and anguish,
until after long mourning and various baptisms,
he was favoured to know mercy to cover the judgment seat:
the Lord was pleased to bind up the bruised reed,
so that he seemed to be brought forth pure, as gold seven times refined,
and was made a chosen vessel, fit for the great Master`'s use.

This part of his religious experience,
the manner in which he was brought to embrace the principles of Friends,
and his answers to some charges which appear to have been urged against him for so doing,
are well set forth by himself, in the following:

[.letter-heading]
Letter to a Friend

Since it has pleased the Divine Goodness to endue me with reason,
I heartily thank his most excellent Majesty;
and that it has been the further product of his good will
to give me life and being in that part of the world,
where I have had the freedom to use it; especially in the choice of my persuasion,
and way of returning my acknowledgments to him.
I wish that all who make any pretensions to religion,
would make use of this noble faculty with subjection to the divine will,
to determine their choice in this grand affair;
and not be tenacious of the religion of their education unless it be that of their judgment.
If people were thus truly wise unto their own salvation,
and did not too lazily resign themselves to the conduct of their guides,
thereby regarding more their ease than safety,
they would not only be the better able to give a reason of the hope that is in them,
but they would show more warmth in their devotion, more charity in their religion,
and more piety in their conduct, than at present they do.

When I was visited some time ago by the chastising hand of the Lord,
for sin and my disobedience to his holy will,
I laboured under great affliction of mind and anguish of spirit:
and though I was constant above many in my attendance on the public prayers of the church,
strict in my observance of its ceremonies,
and exceedingly frequent in the use of private devotion,
yet my burden increased and I waxed worse.

In this wretched and doleful condition,
when at a relation`'s house who had providentially
returned from Pennsylvania to his native country,
I lighted upon R. Barclay`'s [.book-title]#Apology for the Quakers;#
by reading which I was well persuaded of their principles:
and by turning my mind inward to the divine gift--according
to their doctrine--it gave me victory,
in a great measure, over our common enemy, banished away my disorderly imaginations,
and restored me to my former regularity.
I received such comfort and satisfaction to my distressed soul,
that thereupon I left the church of England, and joined myself in society with them:
and I am the more confirmed in my change,
especially where it respects the worship of our Creator,
because it is not only the most agreeable to the Scriptures of truth,
but Heaven has given us assurance of its approbation thereof; it having been at times,
to my own experience, most powerfully attended with the presence of the Most High.

I hope none will grudge me this mercy, because I received it not by their ministry;
if they do, I have cause to suspect their charity is not of a Christian latitude,
since our blessed Redeemer approved not of that narrowness
in his disciples in somewhat a similar case.

But here, to obviate an objection some may make to my change,
because of the distress I lay under, and the discomposure I was subject to at times,
I would have it remarked, that I read the said [.book-title]#Apology# beyond my expectation,
with more sedateness than usual, and a more quiet composure of mind:
so that with the influence of the Almighty, or Providence, or both,
I had also the benefit of that distinguishing faculty
of man reason in the change of my opinion.
O that I may never forget the Lord`'s mercy to my soul!
who had compassion on me when I wallowed in my blood,
and who said to the dry bones, "`Live.`"
O that all such as are visited by the chastising hand of their Maker,
would seriously lay it to heart, and consider their own welfare and salvation.
I could wish with all my heart, that those who labour under this anxiety of mind,
would take encouragement to hope in the Lord`'s mercy through their blessed Redeemer,
by his kindness and long forbearance with me.
I am a living monument of it now; and I hope I shall be so,
while he affords me a being here.
If these lines should come to the hands of any that
are afflicted and distressed as I was,
I have an effectual remedy through mercy, to prescribe unto them:
Turn your minds inward to the grace of God in your own hearts--refrain
from your own imaginations--be still,
and quietly resign yourselves to his holy will; so you shall find health to your souls,
refreshment to your spirits, and the sweet consolations of the Lord in your own bosoms:
you shall find your mourning turned to gladness, and your heaviness to joy.
This has been my experience of the goodness of the Holy One of Israel,
who abhors sin and iniquity, therefore I recommend it to you:
and I think this is no mistrusting of the cause,
for they are the sick and wounded in spirit, not the whole, that need the Physician.

As for renouncing the covenant, which I and every Christian ought to be under,
of forsaking the devil and all his works,
I am so far from entertaining one thought of neglecting that duty,
that I think myself wholly obliged to observe it: and if I should affirm,
that through the grace of God, and his assistance,
for otherwise I am satisfied I cannot do it, the observance of it is possible,
I can find no reason why it should be false doctrine in a Quaker more than in a Churchman.

As for deserting that church and ministry which the
Son of God came down from heaven to establish,
I am not conscious to myself thereof; for I say,
Christ himself is the Head of our church, and by his Spirit and grace,
the Ordainer of our ministry.

As to the last query my ingenious acquaintance is pleased to propose,
I do let him know that my former despair and forlorn condition has been,
since my adhering to that reproached people,
changed into a sweet enjoyment of the goodness of God.
I could not conceal the Lord`'s goodness, lest he should withdraw his mercies from me.

I had no secular interest to corrupt me in this change--it is apparent to many,
I declined it: but as it was peace with God my Maker, and mercy to my soul I wanted,
so having found the pearl of great price among them, I parted with all to purchase it;
or rather, I was restored to all,
I mean the enjoyment of the divine goodness and of myself,
by setting a due value upon it.

This letter presents lively traces of humility, sincerity, disinterestedness,
meekness and modesty,
which qualities seem to have been conspicuous in the character of the writer.
For although qualified by his abilities, both natural and acquired,
to occupy a prominent station in civil and religious society,
yet he declined rather than courted popularity, and sought in a retired life,
to show himself approved unto God, to experience a growth in grace,
and to be made a partaker of solid peace of mind.

He was engaged at times, during the last twenty years of his life,
as a minister of the gospel,
chiefly it is believed in the place and neighbourhood of his residence;
and his brethren were often edified and profitably affected,
not only by his lively ministry, but also by the awful, weighty frame of his spirit,
manifested in the solid gravity of his countenance, as he sat in religious meetings,
feeding in solemn silence on the bread of life.
And when from the fulness of his heart, his mouth was opened to minister,
his words were few and savoury, seasoned with grace,
to the affecting of the hearts of the well-minded, but to the disappointment of some,
who knowing his talents,
expected to hear lengthened discourses delivered in elegant language.
For, abiding under the power of the cross of Christ, as in his general conduct,
so particularly in the exercise of his gift in the ministry,
his aim was of a higher nature than to attract the admiration of men;
the unity of the brethren in the bond of peace--the edifying them in love--and the approbation
of his Maker for the discharge of his duty in simplicity and godly sincerity,
were the important ends which he had in view.
He could therefore acknowledge with the apostle, 1 Cor. 2:1-5,
"`I came not with excellency of speech, or of wisdom,
declaring unto you the testimony of God; for I determined not to know anything among you,
save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
And my speech and my preaching was not with the enticing words of man`'s wisdom,
but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.`"

He was pressing with Friends to be faithful towards God
in the various branches of our Christian testimony;
and especially to keep clear from the antichristian yoke of tithes;
and would often exhort them to be thankful to God
for the manifold mercies received and enjoyed,
and particularly for the privilege of meeting together
without interruption in order to perform divine worship;
also to consider what hardships and sufferings our
worthy ancestors were exposed to on this account.
So good an example of diligence was he in the discharge of this important duty,
that the Friends among whom he resided could not remember
that he ever missed the attendance of one meeting,
except on account of illness.

After he had united in religious fellowship with Friends,
he employed himself in the education of youth,
and kept a school in their meetinghouse at Pontymoil thirty-five years.
He instructed his pupils in the useful parts of literature, as Latin,
Greek and Geography, with various branches of the Mathematics;
but he was chiefly concerned that they might be imbued with the love of virtue,
and that by having religious impressions fixed on their tender minds,
they might be preserved in innocence.
He conscientiously declined instructing them in the heathen authors,
lest they should acquire a disrelish for the principles of true Christianity.
It was his general practice to assemble his family and the scholars in the evening,
for the purpose of waiting upon the Lord in silence,
thus initiating them in serious meditation and retiredness of mind;
and as he felt his way open,
encouraged them in the performance of their moral and religious
duties--particularly this of waiting in silence;
laying before them the benefit arising from this practice,
as affording facility for seeking after that divine influence
which would season their minds with profitable considerations,
and strengthen them to draw near to their Heavenly Father,
with the prevailing language which proceeds from the heart,
when it is awakened to a feeling sense of what it stands in need of.

He officiated as clerk of the monthly meeting to which he belonged,
during most of the time he lived at Pontymoil,
and was very exemplary in the discharge of those duties which devolved upon him,
connected with the discipline, condescending to the weakest member in charity, good-will,
and pure love.
His meekness,
patience and forbearance towards such as by their unguarded
conduct had incurred the censure of the church,
were conspicuous; and the mild manner in which he treated them,
has reached some and brought them to a sense of their deviations.

In addition to many other services which he rendered to the church,
he was frequently engaged with other Friends in visiting
the families of the monthly meeting to which he belonged.

His susceptible mind was sorrowfully affected on account of various
unseemly and immoral practices which prevailed around him,
as "`Horse-racing,`" "`Cock-fighting,`" "`Common
Harvest Shouting,`" "`Profane Swearing,`" etc.,
etc.; and he felt it to be his religious duty, from time to time,
to manifest his concern for the true welfare of his countrymen,
by writing dissuasives from such practices.
These papers he was accustomed to submit to the consideration of his friends;
and they generally directed them to be printed.^

A Short Narrative of Our Friend
J+++.+++ John`'s Affliction and Trouble on Account of His Wife`'s Paying the
Tithe
{footnote-paragraph-split}
Joseph John of Trevthin,
in the county of Monmouth, a Friend of sober life and conduct,
well reported of in the world, and of good esteem among Friends,
held a faithful testimony against antrchristian tithe before his marriage;
and although afterwards he paid it not, yet inasmuch as he allowed his wife,
through his too great indulgence to her,
both to pay it herself and out of his stock to reimburse
her relations who privily paid it for her,
he fell under great exercise of mind and distress for the same, on his deathbed.
He had often spoken to her about it from time to time since their marriage,
but towards the latter end of his days, he had quite omitted to do so.
When on his deathbed, he spoke to her to this effect:
"`I am apprehensive somebody or other has paid the tithe,
or else they would not leave me alone more than others.
The Lord will pass by you--it was I who was in fault:
but I thought to win you by tenderness: yet now it is a burden to me;
do you not pity me?`"
"`Yes,`" said she, "`if I could, I would help you.`"
"`O God!`" said he, "`what shall I do?`"
Then she and others endeavoured to comfort him.
But he said again to her,
"`if you had hearkened unto me formerly`"--and she
being conscious that she had erred in not doing so,
pleaded that she then saw no evil in the payment.
"`I am a hypocrite,`" said he, "`I should not care if all the world knew it.`"
"`O,`" said some of the standers-by, "`you are no such man,
you ought not to be cast down.`"
"`It is no matter to me,`" said he, "`if all the world spoke well of me,
if God rejects me; or if God receives me, if all the world spoke ill of me.
I desire the tithe-mongers would return the money that has been paid them,
and let them come and take it openly,
or distrain my goods according to the course of the
law;--but it will be a great matter if they will.`"
His wife was sorely grieved that she had been the
occasion of this grief and exercise to her husband;
and his brother-in-law who paid the tithe for her, commiserating his condition,
went to the receivers of the tithe to desire them to refund the money.
One of them was very compassionate and readily restored his share, adding,
that he remitted him with all his heart; the others likewise,
in pity to his afflicted condition, sent their shares of the money to him.
When the afflicted Friend heard of it, he said, "`Well,
they were kind! tell them I thank them.`"
His wife being very desirous to know the state of his mind,
would be asking him now and then, how he was?
Once he answered,
"`I am almost gone through the crowd;`" and a few days before his departure, he said,
"`Well, now I have nothing to do but to return thanks:
the Lord works his work without deceit;
blessed be his holy name forever!`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
As all things work
wonderfully where obedience is given to the will and requirings of the Lord,
so the present case is a special instance of his goodness.
His wife is brought under a right sense of her error and wrong-doing,
being not only grieved, as aforesaid, for causing that sore exercise to her husband,
but also resolved to bear a faithful testimony against
that oppressive yoke of tithe for the time to come.
And whereas before she absented herself from meetings for discipline,
she now heartily joins her beloved sisters therein,
and takes a part with them in those affairs of the church which concern
the prosperity of the blessed Truth.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
Blessed
and praised be the Lord`'s most holy,
most worthy and most excellent name,
for his merciful dealings with the sons and daughters of men; and let all the world say,
Amen, Amen.

His friends were affectionately attached to him;
and regarded him as a tender nursing father in Israel--an elder and pillar in the church,
worthy of double honour--one who exercised the oversight thereof,
not as a lord over the heritage, but as an example to the flock.
He was a man of very tender conscience, strict over himself,
and ready to confess his faults to his brethren.

His conduct corresponded with his doctrine and the principles which he professed:
in his conversation he was affable and engaging, instructive and edifying.
His surviving friends manifested their estimation of his
character and exemplary walk by testifying concerning him,
"`His memory is dear to us; and being dead, he yet speaks.`"

Thus having denied himself and taken up the cross to the riches, honours,
and preferments of this world, with the pomps and pleasures thereof,
he looked forward with patience and humble confidence,
to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,
and finished his course in this world in peace, the 17th of the second month, 1746,
aged about 67 years.
His remains were interred in Friends`' burying-ground at Pontymoil aforesaid,
and his funeral was attended by a numerous company of most persuasions and ranks in life.

=== A Testimony From the Monthly Meeting in Monmouthshire, Concerning Evan Bevan

[quote.scripture, , Ps. 37:37]
____

Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright,
for the end of that man is peace.
____

The 17th day of the second month, 1746, departed this life,
our dear worthy innocent Friend, minister and elder, Evan Bevan,
aged about sixty-seven years.
His father`'s name was Charles Bevan, of Lantwit Vardre in Glamorganshire,
who gave him a liberal education at Oxford,
where he made a great progress in various parts of literature.

After he left Oxford, being duly qualified, he practised the law in Glamorganshire,
where he served and executed the office of deputy-sheriff with much reputation; yet,
after some time,
it pleased Divine Providence to visit our said Friend in an extraordinary manner,
he being cast down, as into the deep, in anguish and sorrow,
until after long mourning and various baptizings the Lord
was pleased in mercy to bind up the bruised reed with strength,
so that he seemed to be brought forth as pure as gold seven times refined,
and made a chosen vessel.

And finding unity in his spirit with those of the Society called Quakers,
he joined himself in fellowship with them; as appears more fully by an epistle of his,
published in [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History of the Quakers,# page 706, under the name of Evan Jevans.

He was concerned as a minister about twenty years; not made so by man,
although he was brought up in the languages and sciences of men,
but by a real experience of the power of truth,
and through the demonstration of the gospel.

Oh! in what an awful weighty frame of mind we have seen him sit in meetings,
solidly feeding on the bread of life, which the world knows not of;
and when words flowed from his lips, they were sweet as the honey-comb,
and seasoned with the divine salt; which, with his innocent deportment,
affected the hearts of the hearers, unless grown cold through the love of the world.

He was pressing with Friends, to be faithful towards God,
in the various branches of our Christian testimony;
especially to keep clear from that antichristian yoke of tithes;
the upholding whereof is an indirect denial of the
coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
who, by the one acceptable sacrifice of the offering himself upon the cross,
made atonement to God the Father, brought mankind from under the law,
and put an end thereto, with all types and shadows.
He would often remind Friends to be thankful to God
for the manifold mercies received and enjoyed;
more especially in this time of our uninterrupted meeting together,
in order to perform divine worship; and likewise,
to consider what hardships and sufferings our worthy
ancients were exposed to on this account.

His words were few and savoury, his testimony short;
which was a wonder to such as knew him,
and expected long discourses and eloquent orations; yet he, through divine assistance,
confounded the wisdom of the wise of this world, who therein know not God.
He would most nights wait in silence, together with his family,
and the scholars who lodged with him, and would advise them to that practice,
laying before them the benefit there accruing.

He kept a school in Friends`' meetinghouse in Pontymoil, for about thirty-five years,
and conscientiously refused to teach any of the heathen authors; however,
he brought up many in the useful parts of literature, as Latin, Greek and geography,
with various branches of the mathematics; most of which time he was clerk to our meeting,
and was a tender nursing Father in Israel;
very condescending and forbearing with those who, by undue measures,
had justly deserved the censures of the church.
Sometimes his mild behaviour has reached and convinced the disobedient,
and brought them to a sense of their out-goings.

We do not remember that he missed the opportunity of one meeting, unless through sickness.
He had a great love for Friends, and would visit those who were indisposed.
We had entire love and good will to him, as a cordial, sincere Friend,
and as an elder and pillar in the church, who was worthy of double honour.
His memory is dear to us, and being dead, he yet speaks.
He did not lord it over the church, although his knowledge and wisdom,
both spiritual and natural, might have entitled him to bear rule;
but being clothed with the spirit of meekness and patience,
he would condescend to the weakest member, in charity, good will and pure love;
thereby plainly demonstrating whose disciple he was: yes,
a noble pattern and example was he: his conduct kept pace with his doctrine,
and with the principles he made a profession of.
He was no respecter of persons, yet his conversation was free and agreeable,
chiefly tending to instruction and edification.

He having denied himself, and taken up the cross, to the riches,
honours and preferments of this world, with the pomps and pleasures thereof,
despised the shame, looking forward, in patience,
to the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus, which is the recompense of reward;
in hope of which, the humble contrite soul is enabled to persevere in fear unto the end.

We question not, but our loss is his great gain;
and that now his spirit enjoys the crown of rest and peace,
which is laid up in store for the righteous in the mansions of glory,
where there needs not the light of the sun or moon,
for the glory of God is the light thereof.

His body was interred in Friends`' burying-ground at Pontymoil,
and was attended to the grave with decency and gravity
by a great number of most persuasions and degrees.

=== A Short Narrative of Our Dear and Worthy Friend, Isaac Sharples

[quote]
____

Being now about the 80th year of my age,
it is in my mind to leave some few hints of the Lord`'s
tender dealings with me from my youth to this time,
for the information and encouragement of those I may leave behind me.
I was born near Prescot in Lancashire, about the year 1702, my parents,
William and Phebe Sharples being members of that meeting.
My mother died about three years after, leaving six children, who, by her removal,
were subjected to much hardship.
My father, for lack of keeping his place, forfeited his unity with Friends,
by which the family became dispersed, and none of us continued in the Society.

When I was about twelve years of age,
by the persuasion of some of my father`'s relations, I was sprinkled at Ormskirk;
from which time I continued to frequent the public worship, until I joined Friends.
At about fourteen I was placed out apprentice to a tailor, where I suffered much;
but my master, to whom I was bound, not having sufficient employment for me,
after I had served about half my time,
turned me over to a Friend for the remainder of the term, whereby I got some relief.
And in this family they would often be speaking of my mother,
who was esteemed a valuable Friend.

Having now frequent opportunities of being in Friends`' company,
and observing their regular lives and conduct, it gave me a secret liking towards them;
but looking upon myself to be a settled member of the established church
(so called,) and there being most liberty for worldly indulgence,
I endeavoured to satisfy myself in that way as long as I could;
being often strongly tempted by youthful lusts, after the common evils,
that are in the world; yet I was mercifully preserved from the grosser part thereof.

At length it pleased the Lord, who had long followed me by his secret rebukes,
to break in upon my soul by his powerful love and awakening visitations,
to show me that was not my rest, because it was polluted.
My present state and condition being now clearly laid open to my view,
by the light that shined into my dark heart, I saw sin to be exceedingly sinful,
and that it was that which separated me from my God,
and caused him to withhold good things from me.
I was also favoured to see my great loss of time and neglect of duty,
and how far I was behind in my day`'s work:
for although the Lord was pleased to wink at the time of ignorance,
yet now I found his call and command was to repentance and amendment of life.
And when I set my heart to seek him,
I met with great inward opposition from the combined force of my three potent enemies,
the world, the flesh, and the devil, who assaulted me with manifold temptations.
But forever magnified be my gracious God, he made good the saying of our blessed Saviour;
"`My Father is greater than all,
and none shall be able to pluck you out of my Father`'s hand.`"
Thus, although I was like one cast out and forsaken,
and in great measure destitute of those natural advantages
many are favoured with (my education being low),
yet, in this state of weakness and ignorance,
the Lord took me under his care and protection.

When out of my apprenticeship,
having but few friends or relations that took much notice of me,
I concluded to travel in the way of my trade, and went to London,
where I worked some time.
Afterwards I proceeded westward by way of Oxford, Cirencester, and Bristol,
intending to travel through the western counties, and return again to London.
But I had not gone far from Bristol, before kind Providence,
watching over me for my good, mercifully interposed, directing my way in his wisdom;
he was pleased to put a stop to my roving mind,
and to convince me of the truth of that saying,
"`It is not in man that walks to direct his own steps.`"

Meeting with employment in my trade in the county of Somerset,
and being convinced of the blessed truth, I settled among Friends,
and continued in that part of the country some years; when, about the year 1724,
my mouth was first opened in the work of the ministry at a meeting at Claverham,
in the said county, which I attended for some years, before I went much abroad.
After my stay here about twelve years,
I entered into a married state with Esther Thurston, of Thornbury in Gloucestershire,
a widow, where I then settled.
We lived together in true unity about five years, when she was removed from me by death.

During my residence here,
the Lord laid a concern upon me to pay a religious visit to several northern counties,
and Scotland, also South and North Wales; with which I acquainted my friends,
and having their concurrence and certificate, I set forward,
endeavouring to look with a single eye to my good guide,
who was pleased to enable me to perform this service to my own comfort,
and the satisfaction of my friends: for which,
and for his preservation and care over me every way unto this time,
I bow the knee to my gracious and merciful God.
Although I sometimes set out in great inward poverty,
yet I was secretly supported by an invisible hand, so that I could truly say,
the Lord was my shepherd, and bountifully supplied all my needs,
so as many times to make my cup to run over, filling my heart with his love;
so that I can now say, "`What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits,
who has been my morning light, and I humbly hope will be my evening song?`"

After this journey I continued at Thornbury about five years longer,
visiting the meetings of my friends in most of the western and northwest counties,
as the Lord was pleased to open my way.
And about the year 1743,
a concern was laid upon me to visit the principal towns in the county of Devon,
where there were no Friends;
and notwithstanding the undertaking looked difficult and arduous,
yet as I was preserved in a faithful obedience to the Lord`'s requirings,
he who put me forth was pleased to go before me in such a manner,
that notwithstanding it was sometimes attended with close exercise,
yet through his divine assistance I was enabled to
perform this service to a good degree of satisfaction,
and to meet with no opposition; except in one place from an angry priest.
At several towns I had meetings in the streets and market-houses.
I afterwards went into Dorsetshire and Hampshire,
and passed over into the isle of Jersey in company with my friend Jeremiah Waring.

and the circular yearly meeting there.

1746+++.+++ This year I entered a second time into a married state with Mary,
daughter of our worthy friends Joseph and Mary Ransom, of Hitchin in Hertfordshire,
where I then settled.
She has been a true helpmate to me,
we having now lived together in great unity about thirty-six years.

After my marriage I visited most of the counties of England and Wales at different times,
as the Lord was pleased to open my way, and enable me for it;
through all which I have to acknowledge with thankfulness to my God,
in whose service I went forth, that I lacked nothing,
but was wonderfully preserved and supported:
yet have nothing to glory in but that arm that was made bare for my help,
and have done no more than was my duty to do.
I have had many public services in barns and other
places where there were no Friends settled,
and have attended many marriages and burials not herein particularly noticed,
whereby I have endeavoured to fill up my time:
and under a humbling sense of the Lord`'s goodness,
I can now look back with satisfaction and thankfulness,
to him who has enabled me so far to do my day`'s work in the day time,
and am now favoured in my old age to drink of that Rock,
out of which flow the issues of life; so that now, through his merciful aid,
I can set up my Ebenezer, and say, "`Hitherto the Lord has helped me.`"

I was called into the vineyard when young, and have ever since found work enough to do,
either in digging, watering, or pruning; it not being a time for slothful servants,
nor will it do to put that candle, which has been lighted in us, under a bed or a bushel.
The Lord did not find me out among the wise and prudent of this world;
but he took me from the stones of the street, where, in his wisdom and goodness,
he has often raised up children to Abraham.
I have now to rejoice my day`'s work is so near a happy close,
having only patiently to wait my appointed time, until my change shall come.

Here ends the account our dear Friend gives of himself.

When, through the infirmities attending old age,
he was rendered incapable of going far from home,
he diligently attended his own and neighbouring meetings,
frequently appearing therein in short but lively exhortations,
endeavouring to stir up the minds of Friends to a faithful attention to their duty.
He had a spirit of discerning beyond many,
and an excellent gift in the discipline of the church,
having a clear sight of the insufficiency of the outward form,
without the influence of the divine power to support it to edification.
His ministry was plain and powerful,
often reaching the witness of truth in the hearts of his hearers.

In supplication he was inward and weighty, an awful solemnity covering his spirit,
whereby he was frequently favoured with near access to the throne of Divine Grace.

An innocent cheerfulness, tempered with gravity, adorned his conversation,
and his conduct was a pattern of meekness, moderation, and love,
which gained him general esteem.
Thus persevering in true watchfulness,
the language of the apostle (which he was known frequently
to repeat) may be truly adopted concerning him,
"`Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience,
that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God,
we have conducted ourselves in the world.`"

In his last illness, being sensible his end was approaching,
he expressed himself after this manner: "`I feel my natural faculties fail much;
I desire to be content with the Lord`'s will,
and to wait all the days of my appointed time, until my change shall come;
and it is pleasant to think I draw so near the end of my race,
and can now set up my Ebenezer, and say, '`Hitherto the Lord has been my shield,
and exceeding great reward.`'`"

At another time a few Friends sitting by him, he said,
"`I find my body advancing quickly towards its dissolution;
but death is no king of terrors to me; I hope I shall be ready for my final change:
and although our meeting in this place is but small,
it affords me a secret satisfaction to see the forming Hand at work in some of our youth,
and that they are measurably called into service; which I hope they will give up to.
The world, and the things of it, has lain too near, and hurt the growth of some,
who might have made further advances, had they not been hindered thereby.`"

At another time, speaking of the state of our religious Society, he remarked,
"`Although many have fallen, and some degenerated into form,
yet I believe the truth is kept to in as much simplicity among us, as among any people.
I have often thought of Paul`'s address to the Galatians, his particular converts,
where he says, '`I marvel that you are so soon removed unto another gospel,
which`' says he, '`is not another, but there be some that trouble you,
and would pervert the gospel of Christ; but though we, or an angel from heaven,
preach any other gospel, let him be accursed.`' He then observed,
there was but one gospel, however some may have degenerated into form,
and called it the gospel.

He was favoured to feel very little pain, his complaint being a gradual decay of nature.
He kept his bed about two or three days, during which time he said but little,
although he seemed quite sensible to the last.
About an hour before his end he turned himself in his bed,
and seemed to fall into a sleep; soon after which he quietly departed,
without sigh or groan, the 18th day of the fifth month, 1784,
about the eighty-second year of his age: a minister about sixty years.

Thus our dear and worthy Friend, after a long and well-spent life, finished his course,
and we doubt not has entered that glorious immortality of rest and peace,
prepared for the righteous.
His remains were interred in Friends`' burial-ground at Hitchin, the 23rd,
after a large and solid meeting of Friends and neighbours.
