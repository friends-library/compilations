"`Not by works of righteousness which we have done,
but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing
of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;
that being justified by his grace we should be made
heirs according to the hope of eternal life.`"
